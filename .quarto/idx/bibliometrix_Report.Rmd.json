It shows the structure of a specific field through the linkages between nodes (e.g. authors, papers, journal), while the edges can be differently interpretated depending on the network type, that are namely co-citation, direct citation, bibliographic coupling. Please see Aria, Cuccurullo (2017).\n\nBelow there are three examples.\n\nFirst, a co-citation network that shows relations between cited-reference works (nodes).\n\nSecond, a co-citation network that uses cited-journals as unit of analysis.\n\nThe useful dimensions to comment the co-citation networks are: (i) centrality and peripherality of nodes, (ii) their proximity and distance, (iii) strength of ties, (iv) clusters, (iiv) bridging contributions.\n\nThird, a historiograph is built on direct citations. It draws the intellectual linkages in a historical order.
