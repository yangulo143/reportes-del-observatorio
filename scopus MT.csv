The genus Trifolium Tourn. ex. L. (Fabaceae) is widely dispersed across temperate and subtropical regions, valued for its medicinal properties and as livestock fodder. Despite its worldwide significance, indigenous medicinal and healing knowledge of Trifolium remains undisclosed in local Iranian communities. This study, conducted between 2021 and 2024, involved over 1000 interviews (face-to-face and electronic) primarily in Iran, supplemented by global contributions. Traditional uses of these species were also reviewed through diverse electronic databases spanning more than 70 years. Quantitative ethnobotanical indices (Use-Value and Relative Frequency of Citation), chi-square tests, and chord diagrams were implemented to identify associations and patterns. The results highlight previously undocumented medicinal applications of these species, with leaves being the most utilized part, followed by flowers and stems. Informants, aged 16 to 95, included residents, researchers, traditional healers, and practitioners. Based on the informants’ information, various ailments were treated using Trifolium species. The quantitative ethnobotanical indices represented the species with higher values, while chi-square analysis and chord diagrams further identified within group associations. Given the increasing reliance on medicinal herbs for disease prevention and treatment, integrating indigenous knowledge with contemporary medical expertise is strongly suggested. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Clover; Ethnobotany; Herbal medicine; Indigenous; Leguminosae; Use-value","ethnobotany; global perspective; herb; indigenous knowledge; legume; medicinal plant; phytochemistry; Iran","The work is supported by Shiraz University\u00A0and Payame Noor University.","A.

In this study, a three-factor, three-level Box–Behnken experimental design (BBD) with response surface methodology (RSM) was used to maximize the conditions of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of bioactive compounds from matico and chacruna leaves in terms of total extraction yield (TEY), total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (AA) using ABTS and DPPH assays. The effect of methanol concentration (X1: 25%, 50%, and 75%), time (X2: 3, 6, and 9 min), and power (X3: 90, 270, and 450 W) was evaluated as independent variables. The experimental results were fitted to second-order polynomial models, and multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance were used to determine the suitability of the models, using which 3D response surface plots were generated. Considering the multivariable optimization, the best extraction conditions were 73.68% v/v methanol, 9 min, 269.32 W for matico, and 64.84% v/v methanol, 3 min, 344.44 W for chacruna. Under these conditions, the maximum value of 18.33 and 20.83% for TEY, 7.16 and 40.86 mg GAE/g dm for TPC, 56.88 and 526.38 µmol TE/g dm for DPPH were predicted for matico and chacruna, respectively. Practical Applications: This research focused on the modeling by response surface methodology (RSM) of Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction of bioactive compounds from matico and chacruna, Peruvian plants used in traditional medicine. The methodologies used allow the maximization of bioactive extraction, which presented a high recovery of phenolics with high antioxidant activity. These results highlight the use of Amazon plants in traditional medicine and their possible use in other industries such as cosmetic or food safety. © 2025 by the authors.","antioxidants; Box–Behnken; medicinal plants; phenolics; response surface; yield","","The authors thank the Universidad Nacional de San Mart\u00EDn-PERU for the financial support according to Resolution N\u00B0 623-2022-UNSM/CU-R and Resolution N\u00B0 611-2022-UNSM/CU-R.","J.L.

An ethnographic method was used, with a qualitative approach and direct observation. A total of 72 people, including traditional medics and patients, were surveyed. Ninety percent of participants were familiar with medicinal plants used for treating digestive (94%), respiratory (81%), and dermatological (87%) diseases. Twenty-one frequently used medicinal plants were documented, with leaves and bark being the most commonly used parts. The study revealed a high level of acceptance of traditional medicine, but also highlighted the risk of losing ancestral knowledge and the threat to the ecosystem due to deforestation. It was concluded that traditional medicine contributes to treating and curing diseases; however, there is a perceived high risk of disappearance of some medicinal plants among the Awajún peoples. © 2025, MS-Editions.

However, despite advances in chemical and pharmacological studies on these species, there is a lack of optimized information on these topics. So, a timely bibliographic review is necessary to disseminate the state of the art in the scientific field. In this sense, documents on chemical and pharmacological information related to skin function were searched in the Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases, using the scientific names of each species associated with the terms “chemistry” or “activity.” As a result, 24 documents on the subject were used, excluding those present in the introduction. To date, it has been demonstrated in the literature that both species have extensive antimicrobial activity and relevant antioxidant activity, so that S. americanum also presented anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and healing activity in vivo. In addition, V. macrophylla also acts against several tumor cell lines, which may lead to studies for evaluation in melanoma cells or other skin carcinomas. Other considerations for future studies include the development of suitable topical formulations and clinical trials to evaluate quality, efficacy, and safety in humans. © 2025 Visagaa Publishing House.","Amazonian plants; Hypericaceae; Phytochemicals; Skin diseases; Solanaceae; Wound healing","flavonoid; terpenoid; antiinflammatory activity; antimicrobial activity; Article; biological activity; Candida albicans; chemical composition; controlled study; cytotoxicity; DPPH radical scavenging assay; Escherichia coli; herbal medicine; human; human cell; medicinal plant; pharmacology; phytochemistry; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; skin disease; skin function; Solanum; Solanum americanum; Staphylococcus aureus; traditional medicine; Vismia macrophylla","","R.D.D.G. de Albuquerque; Laboratório de Tecnologia em Produtos Naturais, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil; email: richardcabofrio@gmail.com","","Visagaa Publishing House","25831194","","","","English","Nat.

With the arrival of the Spanish in Cajamarca in 1532, attempts were made to suppress these practices through evangelization; however, cultural resistance and the vastness of the territory favored their persistence, also integrating European elements. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in scientific databases with broad coverage, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science (WOS), supplemented by physical libraries, with the aim of systematizing information related to the historical use and trade of medicinal plants in the department of Cajamarca, Peru. Results: Results: The cultures that inhabited the Cajamarca valleys already practiced healing or shamanism, a tradition that has endured to the present day. During the colonial period, attempts were made to restrict traditional medicine, although species such as cinchona (Cinchona spp.) proved their therapeutic value. In the early and middle republican periods, interest was limited, but inventories and botanical studies were carried out. In the contemporary period, research in various scientific disciplines stands out. Markets supply Cajamarca and the Peruvian coast with medicinal plants, mainly of wild origin. Conclusions: In the department of Cajamarca, the use of medicinal plants and traditional medicine originated in pre-Inca times and has endured throughout history. Today, it is reinforced by scientific contributions that highlight its cultural therapeutic, and economic value. It also plays a strategic role in supplying medicinal plant species to markets. © 2025, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

However, comprehensive studies on the biological activities of its essential oil (EO), particularly from Peruvian sources, remain limited. This study aimed to analyze the chemical composition and enantiomeric profile of A. triphylla EO and evaluate its antibacterial, antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and cytotoxic activities. The EO was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 62 compounds were identified, with (E)-caryophyllene (16.80%), β-pinene (9.96%), and germacrene D (10.00%) being the major components. Enantiomeric analysis revealed specific chiral signatures, including (−)-α-pinene, (+)-limonene, and (R)-(−)-linalool. The EO exhibited significant antibacterial activity, particularly against Bacillus subtilis (MIC = 5 µg/mL), and weak antioxidant activity (IC<inf>50</inf> = 7720 and 4648 µg/mL for DPPH and ABTS, respectively). Additionally, the EO demonstrated moderate acetylcholinesterase inhibition (IC<inf>50</inf> = 87.8 µg/mL) and cytotoxicity in the Artemia salina assay (LC<inf>50</inf> = 964 µg/mL). These findings suggest that A. triphylla EO possesses promising bioactivities with potential applications in pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields. © 2025 by the authors.","Ach; antimicrobial; bioactivity; GC-MS; lemon verbena; volatile oil","antiinfective agent; antioxidant; cholinesterase inhibitor; essential oil; animal; chemistry; mass fragmentography; microbial sensitivity test; stereoisomerism; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antioxidants; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Oils, Volatile; Stereoisomerism","","O.

The study describes the factors that limit institutional childbirth among Ashaninka mothers in the Peruvian Amazon. METHODS The research was descriptive, using a questionnaire administered to 152 Ashaninka mothers from five communities in Río Tambo. RESULTS Most Ashaninka mothers who gave birth at home were between 25 and 29 years old, lived with their partners, came from the Koterini Tarzo community, were Catholic, had incomplete secondary education, were housewives, and had a paternal income of less than or equal to 1000 PEN. They chose home birth for cultural reasons such as privacy, tradition, and economics, preferring traditional birth attendants because of their cultural acceptance and experience. Cultural practices included the burial of the placenta, the use of herbs such as “piri piri,” and vertical births. The perception of inadequate facilities and the prevalence of cesarean sections limit the acceptance of institutional childbirth. Added to this is a preference for female healthcare personnel, a lack of information about health procedures, and the prohibition of cultural practices. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to reform the maternal care model in Indigenous contexts, involving healthcare personnel, policymakers, and local authorities to create culturally relevant and accessible services. It is suggested that an intercultural approach be integrated into professional training and that traditional medicine be combined with the healthcare system. Future studies should evaluate the impact of these interventions on maternal and perinatal outcomes in Indigenous communities. © 2025, Medwave Estudios Ltda.

The curative songs or icaros used by the curanderos (traditional healers) of the Peruvian Upper Amazon are administered alongside the psychoactive plant decoction ayahuasca in ritual settings. This Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis examines musical experiences of 6 participants attending an ayahuasca ritual for personal and spiritual development at the Takiwasi Center in Peru in 2018. Findings offer pointers towards a neurophenomenology of musico-healing experiences with ayahuasca, suggesting that the conjunction of icaros and ayahuasca may contribute to psycho-neurobiological mechanisms of healing such as self-referential processing, decentering, and facilitating access to beneficial introspective/meditative states. The study offers a medical ethnomusicological contribution to the phenomenological mapping of musico-healing experiences of Amazonian curative songs under the altered state of consciousness (ASC) produced by ayahuasca. © 2024 The Author(s).","ASCs; ayahuasca; Icaros; phenomenology; Takiwasi; vegetalismo","","","M.

As a result, the use of medicinal plants has become a practice deeply rooted in traditional medicine. Identifying the main plants used for this purpose, along with their routes of administration and dosage, provides valuable insight into indigenous therapeutic practices for kidney-related ailments. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between 2024 and 2025 in the indigenous communities of Supayaku and Yamakey in Peru. Sociodemographic data and information on the use of medicinal plants were collected through surveys of indigenous individuals over 18 years of age who had knowledge of plant use for treating kidney problems. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. Results: The use of medicinal plants differed significantly in Supayaku and Yamakey. Bixa orellana L. was more abundant in Supayaku than in Yamakey, and Equisetum arvense L. was more prominent in Yamakey than in Supayaku (p = 0.02). Administration duration also differed significantly being longer in Yamakey (23.61 days) than in Supayaku (20.46 days) (p = 0.04). In both communities, plants were mainly field collected (78.57% in Supayaku; 98.21% in Yamakey) and mostly used in infusions (98% in Yamakey and 86% in Supayaku). Conclusions: The study documents the diversity of traditional indigenous medicinal practices for treating kidney problems, highlighting significant differences in species, preparation, and administration of medicinal plants. © 2025, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

Aims: To characterize and find the factors associated with the use of medicinal plants in Honduras. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was carried out by means of Physicians in Social Service (MSS) in hospitals and health institutions; 16,379 respondents were reached in all departments of Honduras, who were asked about their general characteristics, use of medicinal plants and other similar characteristics; descriptive and analytical statistics were obtained. Results: 87.9% (14,398) mentioned that they had used medicinal plants. Their use was higher in the female population (p<0.001), living in a rural area (p<0.001), having been treated with natural medicine (p<0.001), among those who recommended that others be treated with medicinal plants (p<0.001) and those who thought that plants are cheaper than pharmacological treatments (p=0.042); on the contrary, those who thought that drugs were cheaper (p<0.001), those who did not know about the prices (p<0.001) and those who perceived that natural medicine care was cheaper (p<0.001) used fewer natural treatments; adjusted for four variables. Conclusions: The study identified key characteristics and factors associated with the use of medicinal plants in Honduras. These findings offer valuable insights for public health officials and policymakers, especially in countries with similar cultural and socioeconomic contexts within Central America. Understanding the prevalence and types of alternative medicine used across urban and rural populations can help guide health interventions and integrate traditional medicine into public health strategies. © 2025 Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmacognosy Research.","alternative medicine; Honduras; medicinal plants; traditional medicine","herbaceous agent; natural product; adult; advertising; age; Aloe vera; alternative medicine; anise; Article; book; cinnamon; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; drug cost; drug use; ethnicity; Eucalyptus; female; garlic; ginger; health care facility; health survey; Honduras; human; Internet; lemon; male; Matricaria chamomilla; medicinal plant; multivariate analysis; personal experience; prevalence; residence characteristics; rural area; sex; tea; traditional medicine; urban area","","E.

The sample was 27 adult women who self-identified as Quechua. The qualitative analysis made possible the mapping of codes and identification of clusters evidencing three key dimensions: Culture and Tradition, Health and Welfare, and Food and Resources. The semantic network generated from the analysis of the co-occurrence of terms revealed that the family constituted the nucleus around which coping strategies gravitated. The results showed the preponderant role of spirituality, cultural practices, and traditional medicine as emotional and material support. The experience of Quechua women during the pandemic reveals a complex interaction between tradition and adaptation, where ancestral knowledge systems and traditional social structures are mobilized and reconfigured in response to contemporary challenges. © 2025 Universidad de Tarapaca.

In this study, the chemical profile, antioxidant activity, and enzyme inhibition capacity of aqueous and ethanolic extracts obtained from the root, stem, leaves, calyx, and fruits of P. angulata collected in Peru were evaluated. A total of forty-two compounds were detected in the extracts using UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis. In vitro analyses revealed that leaf extracts contained the highest concentration of phenolic compounds, while leaf and fruit extracts showed the best results in FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS antioxidant tests; on the other hand, inhibition of AChE, BChE, α-glucosidase, and α-amylase enzymes was variable, but calyx and fruit extracts showed higher effectiveness. In silico analyses indicated that the compounds physagulin A, physagulin F, physagulide P, physalin B, and withaminimin showed stable interactions and favorable binding affinities with the catalytic sites of the enzymes studied.

This study on Asháninka herbal medicine offers an insight into the Asháninka aetiological system, resting within the wider ontological framework of animism, and cultural expressions of the biomedical understanding of illnesses. Aim of the study: To document wild-grown (non-cultivated) plant species in current use by the Asháninka people and look closer at their herbal practices during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study examines whether the knowledge and use of medicinal plants is gendered in this society. It also compares the findings with available literature concerning the Arawakan groups from Peruvian Amazonia. Material and methods: The fieldwork was conducted in 13 native communities of the Asháninka people along the Tambo River (Selva Central), Peru, between 2016 and 2018 and in 2022. The main field technique were guided walks in the forest with 27 female and 28 male participants, during which voucher specimens were collected and relevant information was recorded. Semi-structured interviews were performed with specialists in Asháninka traditional medicine and with lay Asháninka people to better understand Asháninka illness aetiologies. The analysis of medicinal plants included medicinal categories and uses, modes of preparations, the frequency of use and the knowledge about the plants between the genders. It also presents and discusses detailed testimonies of herbal remedies during the Covid-19 pandemic. The list of recorded plants was compared with ethnobotanical studies of other Arawakan groups from Peruvian Amazonia. Results: Altogether, 169 wild-grown medicinal plant species were documented. Our findings highlight the importance of the Piperaceae and Acanthaceae botanical families in the Asháninka pharmacopoeia. The plants were used for 23 medicinal categories, of which dermatological disorders, digestive problems and venomous bites were the most prevalent. Over 70% of recorded plants were commonly and moderately known by the study participants. More exclusive species were found among the men than women; however, 64 % of all recorded plants were known to both genders. Sixty-one percent of recorded plants were not mentioned by any other study of medicinal plants among other Arawakan groups in Peruvian Amazonia. During the Covid-19 pandemic, nobody in the native communities at the Tambo River died directly due to the virus, which was attributed, amongst others, to effective and culturally-appropriate prophylaxis and treatments with medicinal plants. Conclusion: To this day, the Asháninka people at the Tambo River conserve the knowledge and practices related to medicinal plants which meet the daily needs of dwelling in subtropical forest; these are deeply rooted in animistic ontology, with the emphasis on spirit predation and retaliation. And yet, numerous applications of plants are compatible with the biomedical notion of illness and symptoms. Plant knowledge is shared between the genders, although specific plants exist for men and women, which are related to their gendered social and family roles. Some overlap and consensus exists with other studies regarding medicinal uses, which reflects the rich and diverse knowledge of medicinal plants among the Arawakan groups in Peruvian Amazonia, and this deserves further study. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Covid-19 phytotherapy;

Healthcare models that include Indigenous medicine and traditional healers present an important avenue for addressing such inequalities, as they increase cultural adequacy of services, healthcare access, and acknowledge Indigenous Rights for their perspectives to be represented in public healthcare. Understanding the underlying epistemologies of Indigenous medicine is a prerequisite for this purpose. Thus, in order to support Indigenous Organizations and governmental initiatives to develop more inclusive healthcare approaches, the current study investigated key epistemic concepts in Indigenous-Amazonian medicine from the perspective of traditional healers. We conducted systematic in-depth interviews (semi-structured) with a sample of 13 healers of three Peruvian-Amazonian regions (Loreto, Ucayali, San Martín). Data was analysed using manifest qualitative content analysis. Our findings point to an intricate medical system based on a sophisticated understanding of health, illness, and treatment. Indigenous healers described multifactorial aetiology concepts, complex interactions between material and spirit-related aspects of body and nature, diagnosis, and treatment. These often involved carefully designed applications of ‘teacher plants’, a concept at the heart of this medical system. Furthermore, while the healers considered traditional and biomedicine as complementary systems, they identified the lack of recognition of traditional healers as a primary barrier for collaboration. Indeed, preconceptions and stigma on Indigenous medicine along with a paucity of research, still represent an impediment to countries’ ability to respond to Indigenous peoples’ health-related expectations and needs, thus maintaining existing inequalities. This work offers a significant contribution to the understanding of Indigenous-Amazonian medicine and perspectives of traditional healers, relevant for Peru and adjacent countries sharing Amazonian territory and cultures. Our findings also highlight Amazonian healers’ unique expertise around the therapeutic applications of psychoactives, from which the current revival of clinical scientific interest in psychedelic-assisted therapies may have a great deal to learn. © 2025 Berlowitz et al.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 211 Quechua-speaking postmenopausal women from the Chontayoc community (Huaraz-Peru, 3139 m asl), who suffered from depression and refused either pharmacologic treatment or psychotherapeutic treatment. A questionnaire was administered between April and September 2024, following voluntary informed consent and approval by the ethics committee. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 24. The χ2 test was applied with a significance level of 0.05. Results: The majority of postmenopausal women (123, 58.3%) refused pharmacologic treatment for depression, while 162 (76.8%) and 181 (85.8%) women expressed distrust of the professional competence of health personnel and preference for the use of traditional medicine, respectively. The institutional and cultural factors that showed a statistically significant relationship with the rejection of depression treatment were distrust of the professional competence of health personnel, health care in a language other than Quechua, fear of treatment, distrust of its effectiveness, little information provided by health personnel, preference for the use of traditional medicine, shame and fear of community rejection, belief that depression treatment causes madness, and belief that depression is normal in postmenopausal women (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Institutional and cultural factors are associated with the rejection of depression treatment in Quechua-speaking indigenous postmenopausal women from the Chontayoc community, so multisectoral intervention measures with an intercultural approach are required. © 2025 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.","depression; indigenous people; menopause; mental health","","","A.F.

Despite its widespread use, existing research on the safety, efficacy, and integration of TCI medicine within conventional healthcare systems is fragmented. This fragmentation highlights the urgent need for a clearly defined global research agenda to guide future studies, secure funding, and inform governance in this field. Methods The Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine Unit at the World Health Organization Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland coordinated an international research priority-setting exercise using the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) method between June and December 2023. We invited a purposive sample of 120 experts from established academic networks to participate; 53 experts (44.16% response rate) contributed, and 34 of them scored 157 unique research ideas according to five CHNRI criteria: feasibility, effectiveness, deliverability, equity, and potential for disease burden reduction. Additionally, we performed a comparative analysis by generating research priorities using large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Grok 3, and these outputs were compared with the expert-derived priorities. Results Top-ranked research priorities focused on chronic disease management (e.g. diabetes, dyslipidemia), geriatric safety (e.g. herb-drug interactions), mental health (e.g. resilience and mood disorders), and integration of TCI into health systems. Priorities varied by income setting. Comparison with LLM-generated lists showed thematic overlap in efficacy and safety but divergence in focus, with LLMs emphasising research capacity, policy, and systems-level priorities. Conclusions We established a global, expert-informed research agenda to guide the future direction of TCI medicine and ensure alignment with public health needs. The comparison with LLMs highlights the complementary potential of artificial intelligence in research governance and agenda-setting. © 2025 The Author(s)","","alternative medicine; comparative study; consensus; global health; human; integrative medicine; medical research; research; traditional medicine; World Health Organization; Biomedical Research; Complementary Therapies; Consensus; Global Health; Humans; Integrative Medicine; Medicine, Traditional; Research","We would like to extend our gratitude to all participants for their invaluable contributions to this study.

Indigenous communities continue to have concerns, however, about their ability to ensure intergenerational transfer of Indigenous traditional medicine knowledge. These concerns stem from the continued lack of Indigenous rights as a result of colonization, a lack of protection of land rights and different levels of Indigenous self-determination around the world, all of which affect traditional medicine access and practices. Indigenous Peoples’ access to their traditional medicine systems will therefore continue to depend on their access to self-determination, land and cultural rights, as well as on Indigenous data sovereignty. A balanced approach to Indigenous health and well-being is needed that prioritizes Indigenous traditional practices, community involvement, and Indigenous cultural and language revitalization (with support for ongoing intergenerational knowledge transfer). These elements are important for bringing back ecological harmony to Indigenous Peoples, communities and the planet. Additionally, with sufficient resources and support, Indigenous Peoples and their concepts of health can be a blueprint for harmony for people and health systems more widely, with Indigenous Peoples being a key determinant of planetary health. We outline some key points to ensure that the concepts of health and well-being of Indigenous Peoples and their Indigenous traditional medicine systems are maintained going forward for individual, community and planetary health. © 2025, World Health Organization.

In Peru, these practices, particularly the use of therapeutic plants, are legally protected and commonly used for treating certain conditions. However, the lack of inclusion of T&CM in medical education puts these practices at risk of disappearing. To analyze the inclusion of T&CM courses in the curricula of medical schools in Peru to identify gaps and opportunities for improving medical education and ensuring comprehensive training for future healthcare professionals. A cross-sectional study was conducted by reviewing the curricula of 47 Peruvian medical schools. Data on the presence, structure, and content of T&CM courses were extracted and analyzed descriptively. In 2024, 15 out of 47 Peruvian universities offering Human Medicine programs (31.9 %) included T&CM courses. Among them, 73 % were public institutions, and 53 % were located in coastal regions. The most common topics were Traditional Chinese Medicine (93.3 %), Traditional Peruvian Medicine (87 %), phytotherapy (93 %), and acupuncture (80 %). Course structure varied: 60 % of courses were elective, while 40 % were mandatory. Most universities (93 %) allocated 2-3 academic credits, and 80 % incorporated practical training, though structured field visits were rare (6.7 %). Additionally, 53 % of universities included research activities. The lack of standardized curricular guidelines led to variability in course content and depth across institutions. Few universities in Peru teach T&CM, highlighting a need to enhance medical education. Increasing T&CM topics in curricula and addressing information access disparities are crucial. © 2025Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","complementary therapies; curricula; medical education; traditional medicine","","","J.

Methods: A qualitative and analytic study was carried out using semi-structural interviews applied to patients recruited through a convenient sample limited by thematic saturation among individuals attending the Diabetic Foot Unit of Hospital Regional Lambayeque. The results were registered, transcribed, coded, and categorized manually with thematic analysis. Results: Ten individuals were interviewed. Three categories were obtained: a. myths and beliefs about the genesis of DF; unknown and spontaneous origin, the religion imposes the belief that DF are the results of divine punishment, magico-religious causes (witchcraft), or inadvertent lesions. B. myths and beliefs around management: avoid food that exacerbates DF, use of anti-inflammatory herbs, and request for a sorcerer consultation or auto prescription. C. living with fears and anxiety: amputation and limitations. Conclusion: Myths and beliefs were identified that need to be taken into account by healthcare professionals to improve the management of DF. © Revista Médica Herediana.","culture; Diabetic foot; fear; interview; patient education; traditional medicine","adult; Article; clinical article; consultation; controlled study; diabetic foot; female; foot care; human; male; medical ethics; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outpatient; patient education; patient participation; prescription; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; semi structured interview; thematic analysis","","F.

From March 2019 to November 2022, semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven families dedicated to raising stingless bees. The communities’ knowledge includes harvesting honey, particularly from species such as neronto or pitsi (Melipona eburnea), and shinkenka (Tetragonisca angustula), emphasizing practices that protect tree integrity and align with seasonal cycles. The honey, primarily used in traditional medicine, is valued for treating respiratory ailments, reflecting a deep interconnection between cultural practices and ecological stewardship. Additionally, the Ashaninka identify over 14 plant species utilized by bees to construct their nests, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of local biodiversity. This ethnological report is the first to document these ancestral practices within Ashaninka culture, offering critical insights into their conservation efforts. By integrating ТЕK with elements of cultural narrative, this study underscores the importance of incorporating indigenous knowledge into sustainable resource management strategies in the Amazon, advocating for a holistic approach to biodiversity conservation that honors both ecological and cultural dimensions. © (2025), (Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco).

As a consequence, tobacco smoking is now one of the largest public health problems worldwide. However, in the Peruvian Amazon, a region of origin of tobacco species, Indigenous healers still know how to use the plant for therapeutic purposes. Due to a general disregard of Indigenous knowledge and stigma, these uses have however not so far been clinically investigated. We hence conducted for the first time a clinical field study assessing a sample of patients treated by a traditional healer specialized in tobacco in the Peruvian Amazon (observational design, pilot study, N = 27). The study was conducted within a transdisciplinary and multi-epistemic medical frame, in close partnership with an Amazonian healer. We used validated self-report scales to quantitatively assess mental health variables before and after the weeklong treatment, and mixed-methods to report experienced effects. Paired-samples t-tests comparing pre- and post-treatment scores revealed significant reductions in anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and general symptom indicators. Experienced effects included initial physical discomfort, followed by psychologically or existentially/spiritually significant insights. Our findings point to a sophisticated therapeutic approach based on Indigenous knowledge of tobacco applications, which should be further investigated. The study also contributes to the burgeoning scientific field on therapeutic uses of contentious psychoactive plants. © The Author(s) 2023.","ayahuasca; Indigenous medicine; Nicotianaspp; Peruvian Amazon; psychoactive; tobacco","adult; female; human; male; middle aged; Nicotiana; Peru; pilot study; symbolism; tobacco use; traditional medicine; Adult; Ceremonial Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Tobacco Use","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Grant No. 190428).","I.

It is considered a commercially valuable fruit tree cultivated worldwide for its rich oil content. It has various medicinal properties throughout the plant, including fruits, roots, leaves, and seeds. Conventionally, it has been used to treat malaria, obesity, urinary incontinence, and anemia, and protect against sunlight and skin diseases. However, as avocado is a plant species with worldwide knowledge, it is necessary to constantly review recently published articles, according to the topic of interest. Therefore, the objective of this review is to compile and discuss recent studies (2010–2024) on ethnomedicinal, pharmacological, and chemical information of P. americana. Articles were searched from the following electronic databases: Scopus (n = 62), ScienceDirect (n = 70), and PubMed (n = 194). Regarding the in vivo pharmacological effects, studies suggest potential benefits for diabetes, gastric ulcers, and others, likely due to reduced glucose levels. In vitro studies mainly focused on antioxidant/anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. These findings demonstrate a high diversity of pharmacological activities achievable with P. americana extracts through various administration forms (decoction, juice extract, and infusion) and plant parts. Overall, P. americana shows promise as an effective alternative treatment for various health issues. © 2024 José Gilberto Gavídia-Valencia, et al.","Aguacate; Avocado; Ethnomedicine; Ethnopharmacology; Palta; Pharmacological activities; Phytoconstituents","alkaloid; benzoic acid; caffeic acid; catechin; chlorogenic acid; fatty acid; flavonoid; gallic acid; glucose; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; oleic acid; palmitoleic acid; Persea americana extract; plant extract; polyphenol; quercetin; sterol; unclassified drug; analgesic activity; anemia; antiinflammatory activity; antineoplastic activity; antioxidant activity; avocado; carbohydrate metabolism; central nervous system disease; chemical composition; diabetes mellitus; drug activity; HCT 116 cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; kidney dysfunction; lipotoxicity; malaria; nervousness; obesity; Review; Scopus; skin disease; skin maceration; stomach ulcer; traditional medicine; urine incontinence","","R.D.D.

The objective of this qualitative study is to explore the perspectives and practices of traditional healers in Peru in relation to abortion. In-depth interviews were carried out with 20 traditional healers in the Piura Department in 2018. Participants recognized that women in their community seek menstrual regulation services given delayed menses or “retenciones” and acknowledged that pregnancy might or might not be the cause of menstrual delays. While most participants confirmed that they perform menstrual regulations, the majority denied practicing abortion services. This study shows the key role that traditional healers play in supporting their communities' sexual and reproductive health and acknowledges their perspectives and concerns in relation to abortion. It is essential that traditional medicine is respected and honored while developing strategies to eradicate abortion stigma. © The Author(s) 2024.","abortion; Latin America; Peru; Shamanism; Traditional medicine","","","E.E.

K.D. Hill & L.A.S. Johnson. The objective is to determine the ethnobotany and the total phenolic and flavonoid content of C. citriodora. The ethnobotanical information was gathered using a semi-structured questionnaire from herbalists in markets in the city of Trujillo, La Libertad, Peru. Corymbia citriodora was collected in Agallpampa, Otuzco, and identified in the Herbarium Truxillense. Three extracts were prepared and evaluated (infuse, decoct, and hydroethanolic). The total phenols were quantified using the Folin Ciocalteau method, and total flavonoids were quantified using the aluminum chloride method. Corymbia citriodora reported a higher medicinal use in bronchitis (39.1%), in the preparation of a frequent infusion, made from leaves, often in combination with Piper aduncum (35.7%). Total phenols and flavonoids were reported as 118.65 mg GAE and 33.95 mg QCE per gram of dried drug, with the hydroethanolic extract standing out. The high presence of phenolic and flavonoid bioactives is directly related to anti-inflammatory activity, suggesting that C. citriodora remains a viable option and demonstrates efficacy in a traditional context for improving respiratory conditions. © 2024 Juan Ernesto Valdiviezo-Campos et al.

(A. arborescens) is an aromatic plant used in traditional medicine as an anti-inflammatory, anti-tussive, anti-rheumatic, and anti-diarrheal agent. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of A. arborescens Mill. on a Rattus norvegicus var. albinus-induced breast cancer model. Materials and Methods: We collected A. arborescens from the province of Julcán, La Libertad Region, Per, and prepared an ethanolic extract using pulverized leaves macerated in 96° ethanol for 72 h with magnetic stirring. In the evaluation of anticancer activity, four experimental groups with 10 female rats each were formed: Group I (Control-7, 12-dimethylbenz[a] anthracene [DMBA]), which received DMBA (single dose) and physiological saline solution for 4 months, and Groups II, III, and IV, which received DMBA (single dose) and 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg/day of the ethanolic extract of A. arborescens, respectively, for 4 months. Results: The DMBA control group presented histological characteristics of ductal carcinoma in situ with necrotic and inflammatory areas, whereas the A. arborescens extract group showed a decrease in tumor volume and recovery of the ductal duct. Conclusion: Ethanol extract of A. arborescens leaves decreases tumor development in rats with induced breast cancer, and this effect is dose-dependent. © Silva-Correa, et al.","7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene; Ambrosia arborescens; breast carcinoma in situ; cancer; rat","Ambrosia arborescens extract; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; essential oil; interleukin 6; plant extract; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; Asteraceae; atypical ductal hyperplasia; breast cancer; carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; controlled study; ductal breast carcinoma in situ; female; gene expression; histology; histopathology; inflammation; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phytochemistry; radiation exposure; rat; Rattus norvegicus; seasonal variation; traditional medicine; tumor volume","The authors thank the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Peru, and the Research Group \u201CCompuestos Bioactivos de Inter\u00E9s Biol\u00F3gico (C-BIB)\u201D (Approval Number N\u00B037-2023-VIN-UNT) for the use of the laboratories.

It is necessary to investigate and evaluate these compounds, mostly phenolic, that could be used as drugs. Aims: To identify the polyphenols by UPLC-MS/MS and the potential in silico antiviral activity of medicinal plants in Trujillo, Peru. Methods: The ethnobotany of the eight most widely used medicinal plants in the city of Trujillo was described (Azadirachta indica A. Juss. “paradise”, Caesalpinia spinosa (Molina) Kuntze “tara”, Citrus limon (L.) Osbeck “lemon”, Clinopodium pulchellum (Kunth) Govaerts ""panizara"", Cordia lutea Lam. ""overo"", Ocimum basilicum L. ""basil"", Schinus molle L. ""molle"", and Taraxacum campylodes G.E. Haglund ""dandelion""). The phytometabolites responsible for the antiviral activity were identified by LC-MS and evaluated in silico against the viral proteins NS2B/NS3 (DENV-2), NS5B (HCV), and ICP27 (HSV-1) by molecular docking using Chimera 1.16 software and molecular interaction by Maestro 13.1 software to identify the position and type of interaction. Results: Five polyphenols (chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, and rutin) were found, and in the in-silico test, the antiviral activity of chlorogenic acid stood out against DENV-2 and HCV, rutin against HCV and HSV-1, rosmarinic acid against DENV-2 and HCV. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that the medicinal plants studied contain phytometabolites that make them possible antiviral candidates, which would support their use in the traditional medicine of the province of Trujillo, Peru. © 2024 Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmacognosy Research.","antiviral; ethnobotany; molecular docking; polyphenols; Tandem Mass Spectrometry","aciclovir; antivirus agent; caffeic acid; chlorogenic acid; gallic acid; herbaceous agent; icp27 protein; nonstructural protein 2B; nonstructural protein 3; nonstructural protein 5B; polyphenol derivative; ribavirin; rosmarinic acid; rutoside; sofosbuvir; unclassified drug; viral protein; animal experiment; antiviral activity; antiviral therapy; Article; Asteraceae; Azadirachta indica; basil; binding affinity; Boraginaceae; chemical structure; Clinopodium pulchellum; computer model; Cordia; Cordia lutea; coronavirus disease 2019; dandelion; data analysis; Dengue virus 2; drug absorption; drug distribution; drug excretion; drug metabolism; ethnobotany; flower; fruit; gargle; Hepatitis C virus; herbal medicine; Human alphaherpesvirus 1; hydrogen bond; Lamiaceae; lemon; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver disease; medicinal plant; molecular docking; molecular interaction; mosquito borne disease; nonhuman; Peru; plant leaf; plant seed; rat; respiratory tract infection; Schinus molle; skin infection; Tara spinosa; Taraxacum campylodes; taxonomic identification; ultra performance liquid chromatography","Special thanks to Dr. E.

The objectives of the present study were to develop a sliced bread (SB) enriched with leaf powder from three mango varieties (Kent, Criollo and Edward) and evaluate the total phenolic content, total flavonoid content and antioxidant capacity. The effect of mango leaf powder on the sensory, textural and chromatic parameters of SB was also assessed. The results showed that bread enriched with mango leaf powder (replacing 2%, 6% and 10% of wheat flour in a bread recipe) compared to control SB had a higher total phenolic content (1.16 to 4.03 mg GAE/g) and antioxidant capacity in the DPPH assay (0.15 to 0.76 µmol TE/g) and in the ferric ion-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay (2.33 to 5.36 µmol FeSO<inf>4</inf>/g). Values of chromatic parameters such as lightness (L*) decreased from 59.10 to 40.71, when the mango leaf powder percentage in bread increased due to the presence of pigments such as chlorophylls (0.54 to 0.69 mg/g) and carotenoids (2.04 to 2.48 mg/g). Among enriched breads, SBs with 2% mango leaf powder obtained the highest sensory panel scores in terms of color, flavor and odor. The enriched breads were characterized by lower hardness, chewiness and gumminess compared to the control bread. In conclusion, it can be stated that sliced bread enriched with mango leaf powder can be an excellent potential resource of bioactive compounds. © Copyright by Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences © 2024 Author(s).","antioxidant capacity; bakery product; bread fortification; chromatic parameters; functional food; mango by-product","","The authors would like to thank the Facultad de Administraci\u00F3n Hotelera, Turismo y Gastronom\u00EDa, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola and the Instituto de Investigaci\u00F3n de Bioqu\u00EDmica y Biolog\u00EDa Molecular (UNALM) for their support in the textural analysis.","K.

To design, and monitor the effectiveness of, interventions to ameliorate such impacts, an understanding of the species sold at the markets and their purpose is required, together with a robust (and potentially flexible) baseline. Here we focus on Belén (the largest open wildlife market in the Peruvian Amazon) and Modelo market, in Iquitos, Peru. Methods: We surveyed wildlife products for sale at both markets approximately weekly over a year, using two different survey methods (open and discreet). To provide a baseline to support future conservation monitoring, we estimated a number of different market metrics (including indices of product availability, volume (observed per survey), and price), for the most frequently observed species ‘groups’, and compared indices of trade volume with daily river water levels. To provide a complete understanding of the range of species involved, we also described all threatened species recorded at the markets, the products sold, and their uses, including those that were only observed occasionally. Results: Both markets sold predominantly wild meat, and some pets; at Belén Market >30% observations were of decorative, spiritual, or medicinal products. At least 71 unique species (including mammals, reptiles, birds, and invertebrates) were observed in total. The most frequently observed species ‘groups’ were: lowland paca, peccaries, caiman, river turtles, boas, yellow footed tortoise, parrots, and brocket deer. 27.7% of species were threatened or Near Threatened globally or nationally but there was no evidence that discreet surveys increased their detection. Daily river water levels were positively correlated with indices of trade volume for lowland paca, caiman, and yellow-footed tortoise, and negatively correlated with indices of trade volume for parrots and river turtle eggs. Discussion: Beyond providing a comparative dataset, and insights regarding the apparent availability and value of a diversity of products (including food items, live pets, and other decorative, spiritual, and medicinal items), we suggest that simulations using these data could be used to optimize future monitoring efforts. Finally, our observations of correlations of per survey trade volumes of some species with daily river water levels in Iquitos may inform optimal time of year for species- specific surveys. © © 2024 D’Cruze, Elwin, Perez-Peña, Vieto, Asfaw and Harrington.","belief-based use; illegal wildlife trade; pets; traditional medicine; wild-meat","","The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Objective: To describe the home care of the hospitalized child with acute respiratory infections from a cultural approach. Method: Descriptive qualitative study. The sample was represented by 12 mothers of children under five years of age with hospitalized acute respiratory infections. The data was collected through the semi-structured interview and was processed through content analysis. Results: Three categories are established: a) Use of traditional medicine as an ancestral practice to treat acute respiratory infections, b) Eating habits during acute respiratory infections, c) Clothing and hygiene customs against acute respiratory infections. Conclusions: The mothers treat respiratory infections with medicinal plants that are native to their community. There are positive aspects that must be preserved, such as providing breastfeeding during illness, but daily bathing must be negotiated, and oversleeping the child must be restructured. Likewise, the nursing staff must have knowledge about traditional medicine and its effects, in order to provide intercultural health education. © 2024 Ingrid Fiorella Murillo-Ruiz, Yolanda Beatriz Villarreal-Ortiz, Rosa Jeuna Díaz-Manchay, Angelica Soledad Vega-Ramírez, Flor de María Mogollón-Torres, Maribel Albertina Díaz-Vásquez.","caregivers; Home care services; oxygen inhalation therapy; qualitative research","","","R.J.

USP quality standards are used in more than 140 countries and are legally recognized by more than 40 countries. Currently, there is renewed interest in herbal medicines globally, and health policies are being implemented worldwide for the use of complementary and traditional medicine. In response, USP has developed a robust body of monographs that can be used to guide industry and regulators in ensuring the quality and safety of botanical ingredients used in dietary supplements and herbal medicines. Throughout the Pan American regions, there is a strong tradition of using botanicals as herbal medicines and, as in other regions, a growing desire for botanical dietary supplements. This underscores the need for public quality standards to ensure quality, reduce the flow of substandard and adulterated products, and ensure public health and safety. In April 2022, USP launched the Pan America Botanical Dietary Supplements and Herbal Medicines Expert Panel, with experts representing 12 different countries. The Expert Panel’s work focuses on developing quality control standards for the most important botanical ingredients used in the respective countries, ingredients that are also of global importance. This article provides an overview of the state of botanical dietary supplements and herbal medicines in different Pan American regions with a focus on the regulatory status of herbal products, the development of national quality and research initiatives, and policies related to agriculture conservation and sustainability, among other topics. © © 2024 Upton, Agudelo, Cabrera, Caceres, Calderón, Calzada, Camacho, da Costa, Dobrecky, Enciso, Escobar, Fakhary, Fletcher, Gao, Lock, Mata, Parada, Perera, Pombo, Reich, Sanchez, Simirgiotis, Sood, Amiguet, Villar, Ghelman, Schveitzer, Portella, Wolffenbüttel, Ruppelt, Frickmann, Gavillan-Suarez, Allen, Alvarado, Sarma, Marles, Monagas and Navarro-Hoyos.","botanicals; dietary supplements; herbal medicines; quality; standards","agriculture; dietary supplement; health care policy; herbal medicine; medical literature; nonhuman; pharmacology; public health; quality control; review; traditional medicine; United States; Western Hemisphere","Funding text 1: In the United States., research initiatives typically involve various organizations and agencies including the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS) and National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NIH-NCCIH), U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), American Herbal Pharmacopoeia (AHP), American Herbal Products Association (AHPA), and American Botanical Council (ABC), as well as several botanical research centers of excellence such as the National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR) of the University of Mississippi, that are partially funded by the FDA. These and other initiatives receive funding from different sources, including the government, such as FDA/NIH entities, among others, and often collaborate with private industry partners. In the United States., private research is also performed by companies that often do not publish the research due to its proprietary nature.; Funding text 2: Regarding Pan American countries, many have government-sponsored initiatives that support medicinal plant research. These initiatives can include regulatory agencies, research institutes, and programs focused on integrating traditional medicine into their national health systems. For example, in Central America and the Caribbean, including the TRAMIL research group, international organizations, and development programs contribute to funding and collaboration in medicinal plant research. There is financial support from international entities such as WHO/PAHO, UNESCO, the EU, and other intergovernmental organizations (). Also important for the natural product research activity in Pan Am countries has been the creation of the Italo-Latin American Society of Ethnomedicine (SILAE), established in 1993 (). The fundamental objective of SILAE is to \u201Cpromote the research, development, and use of medicinal and food plants in different countries of the world\u201D. SILAE activities have supported doctorate, post-doctorate, and visiting scientist exchange programs, regular international conferences, and opportunities for collaborations between the different countries\u2019 members.; Funding text 3: In Canada, medicinal plant research is multifaceted and involves universities, the natural health product industry, and government agencies.

It is important to note that essential oils and extracts of aromatic plants have been recognized for many years as a great source of pharmaceutical agents and food additives. In recent years, there has been great interest in the experimental study of the essential oils of this plant for its therapeutic usefulness. Researchers have increasingly become interested in identifying chemical compound present and how act in different systems of our organism. This chapter discusses the applications of Shinus molle essential oil in the food industry, agriculture, as well as the uses derived from traditional medicine, which have been pharmacologically supported. The bioactive components found in the extracts and essential oil of the Schinus molle plant would be responsible for their antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, insecticidal, antioxidant, and many others pharmacological effects. © 2025 Valdir Florêncio da Veiga Jr., Isiaka Ajani Ogunwande and José L.

Primates, which represent the third most specious Order of mammals, are facing an extinction crisis. Currently, 69% of primate species are listed by the IUCN as threatened (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) and 94% have declining populations. Here, we examine two primary threats to primate population persistence, namely the commercialized hunting and capturing of wild primates and their body parts for food, traditional medicine, pets, and use in biomedical research. Both the legal wildlife trade and illegal wildlife trafficking represent multibillion-dollar industries that contribute to primate population decline, a reduction in genetic diversity, and local extirpation. Trade and trafficking also can lead to the emergence of infectious diseases, increasing biosecurity risks to humans. Between 2015 and 2021, CITES reported 337,511 live primates representing at least 99 species were legally traded, with 6.5% sourced directly from the wild. The recent indictment of Cambodian officials for allegedly laundering wild-caught long-tailed macaques into the U.S. by labelling them as captive-bred, highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability. Comprehensive data on the illegal trafficking of primates are extremely difficult to obtain. However, between 2009 and 2017, primates accounted for 20% of all seizures of illegally traded mammals in the air transport sector. International wildlife trafficking is dominated by criminal networks, corruption, and driven by the demands of wealthy consumers. In addition, the internet has expanded international opportunities to connect buyers and sellers of wild-caught primates and their body parts. Despite explicit bans on selling endangered primates, social media sites continue to do so. Moreover, data on the global food security index (GFSI) indicate that as the international demand for wild live primates, their meat, and other body parts has continued to increase, the majority of people in primate range nations have remained food insecure. Given that almost 70% of primate species are negatively impacted by hunting and trapping, we offer a set of recommendations to reduce the trade and trafficking of wild primates. © © 2024 Garber, Estrada, Shanee, Svensson, Arregoitia, Nijman, Shanee, Gouveia, Nekaris, Chaudhary, Bicca-Marques and Hansen.","conservation; corruption; extinction; pet trade; zoonotic spillover","","The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Theoretical framework: Traditional Aymara medicine is a current medical system practiced by peasant health agents, who still have a particular profile, where leadership, sensitivity, vocation, especially of service, stand out. It is still a system that responds to the health needs of the population. In the last two years, Aymara medicine resisted the Covid-19 pandemic with its own local resources, highlighting herbal medicine, the use of mineral and animal by-products in the diagnosis and treatment of post-Covid-19 patients. Method: This is an interpretative qualitative case study with ethnographic design through which the perceptions and practices of health restoration of doctors and Aymara patients affected by Covid-19 are analyzed. The research was conducted in the Aymara peasant communities of the provinces of Chucuito, El Collao and Puno in the districts of Acora, Chucuito and Pichacani, in the department of Puno (Peru) during the period 2021-2022. Results: The results show that ancestral Aymara medicine is an integral medical system that responds to a set of knowledge and know-how for the treatment of various physiological and cultural diseases. The guinea pig is important in traditional medicine, it is used as an ""X-Ray"" and has efficacy in the diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and prognosis of diseases caused by Covid-19 in the Aymara communities. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

Since ancient times, the origin and development of natural and traditional medicine have been intrinsically linked to humanity struggle for survival. Nowadays, ethnobotanical studies are employed as a tool for the preservation and conservation not only of taxonomic biodiversity but also of cultural biodiversity. Methodology: A descriptive research with a quantitative, non-experimental cross-sectional design was carried out. The study was conducted in six Quechua-speaking communities in the district of Incahuasi (3,000 meters above sea level), selected for convenience considering factors such as altitude, accessibility, and proximity to the city. A questionnaire was administered to 32 residents from the communities, who shared their knowledge about medicinal plants, providing relevant information about them. The gender of the participants was considered because men and women use traditional medicine and the knowledge of them is transmitted from parents to children. Results: During the study, a total of 46 medicinal species were recorded, belonging to 42 genera and 22 botanical families. The most representative medicinal families used by the informants of the communities were Asteraceae (30.4%) and Lamiaceae (15.2%).

Maca’s chemical composition varies due to ecotypes, growth conditions, and post-harvest processing, contributing to its intricate phytochemical profile, including, macamides, macaenes, and glucosinolates, among other components. This review provides an in-depth revision and analysis of Maca’s diverse bioactive metabolites, focusing on the pharmacological properties registered in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Maca is generally safe, with rare adverse effects, supported by preclinical studies revealing low toxicity and good human tolerance. Preclinical investigations highlight the benefits attributed to Maca compounds, including neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory properties, immunoregulation, and antioxidant effects. Maca has also shown potential for enhancing fertility, combating fatigue, and exhibiting potential antitumor properties. Maca’s versatility extends to metabolic regulation, gastrointestinal health, cardio protection, antihypertensive activity, photoprotection, muscle growth, hepatoprotection, proangiogenic effects, antithrombotic properties, and antiallergic activity. Clinical studies, primarily focused on sexual health, indicate improved sexual desire, erectile function, and subjective wellbeing in men. Maca also shows promise in alleviating menopausal symptoms in women and enhancing physical performance. Further research is essential to uncover the mechanisms and clinical applications of Maca’s unique bioactive metabolites, solidifying its place as a subject of growing scientific interest. © © 2024 Ulloa del Carpio, Alvarado-Corella, Quiñones-Laveriano, Araya-Sibaja, Vega-Baudrit, Monagas-Juan, Navarro-Hoyos and Villar-López.","clinical studies; glucosilonates; Lepidium meyenii; maca; macaenes; macamides; pharmacology; preclinical","busulfan; chloroquine; cisplatin; doxorubicin; endocannabinoid; antihypertensive activity; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; chemical composition; drug effect; drug safety; drug toxicity; ecotype; fatigue; growth; harvest; heart protection; human; immunoregulation; Lepidium meyenii; metabolite; neuroprotection; nonhuman; pharmacology; phytochemistry; Review; sexual behavior; sexual function; sexual health; traditional medicine; wellbeing","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the institutional support from the Seguro Social de Salud-EsSalud, the United States Pharmacopeia, and the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.; Funding text 2: The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

This recognized worldwide situation prompts to greater efforts to discover antimicrobial agents of natural origin, including plant sources. The objective of this work was to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of extracts, fractions and pure compounds from Rauhia multiflora using a bioguided complementary fractionation, contributing also to explain some traditional uses of this genus. Some subfractions showed antimicrobial activity against the Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Galantamine was identified and isolated as the main alkaloid, together with two additional structures of the same skeleton. Characterization by GC-MS revealed the presence of twelve galantamine-type and four crinane-type compounds. The tentative structure of one of the galantamine-type skeletons is proposed here for the first time.

Self-care is a strategy to achieve this. Objective: To know the foot self-care practices reported by people with type 2 diabetes mellitus from a qualitative approach. Methods: Qualitative descriptive study. 12 people participated, selected by thematic saturation and redundancy and convenience sampling. Data collection was carried out between April and May 2023, through a semi-structured interview. Data processing was through thematic content analysis. Results: No glycosylated hemoglobin was found in the medical records and the center does not have a diabetic foot unit. In the analysis, four categories were found: a) Habits in examination, hygiene, nail trimming, drying and moisturizing the feet, b) Choice of footwear, c) Use of traditional medicine, d) Self-learning and need for education sanitary for self-care of the feet. Patients reported inspecting, washing, and drying their feet; Some do not hydrate them, do not cut their nails properly, walk barefoot, and prefer to use home-made therapeutic alternatives instead of going to the health center. They receive partial support from their family and limited education from health personnel for self-care. Conclusions: There are some adequate and other deficient practices in relation to foot self-care, limitations in educational aspects by health personnel, resource limitations in the hospital studied and partial social support in patients. © 2024 Publicado por Cuerpo Médico Hospital Nacional Almanzor Aguinaga Asenjo.

Multiple actors hold relevant knowledge for sustainability including indigenous and local people who have developed over generations knowledge, methods, and practices that biodiversity and ecosystem assessments need to capture. Despite efforts to mainstream knowledge coproduction, less than 3% of the literature on nature's contributions to people (NCP) integrates indigenous and local knowledge (ILK). Approaches and tools to better integrate scientific and ILK knowledge systems in NCP assessments are urgently needed. To fill this gap, we conducted interviews with ILK experts from Abancay and Tamburco, Peru, and convened focus groups and workshops during which participatory mapping, a serious game, a Bayesian belief network based on ILK were introduced. We inventoried 60 medicinal plants used to treat different illnesses, and analyzed the spatial distribution of the 7 plants that contribute the most to a good quality of life, and delineated their nonmedicinal uses. Based on the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services conceptual framework, we defined dimensions of a good quality of life according to indigenous and local worldviews. Medicinal plants contributed strongly to health and household security, among other contributions. Climate change and overexploitation were the main perceived threats to medicinal plants, despite the existence of formal and customary institutions to regulate trade. Our approach was flexible enough to integrate diverse forms of knowledge, as well as qualitative and quantitative information from, for example, the Bayesian belief network. © 2023 The Authors.

The ethnic has been studied to a limited extent from an ethnobotanical perspective. The study area is located in the Ucayali region, eastern Central Amazon, where ancestral knowledge is preserved due to the limited accessibility of the region. Between November 2010 and June 2015, a total of 11 months were spent on the survey, which included a short-term visit to complete voucher specimen collection and taxonomic identification. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 Cashinahua traditional healers and 10 midwives. Vernacular names, ethnomedicinal uses, plant parts used and forms of preparation and administration were recorded. Ethnopharmacological, pharmacological and phytochemical uses were checked through survey of the previously published papers indexed on Web of Science databases between 2018 and 2022. We obtained data on 467 plant taxa, among which we highlighted 79 species unreported or rarely cited for medicinal use or phytochemical analysis. These species were spread over 60 genera and 42 botanical families, with Acanthaceae being the most represented. Leaves were used the most frequently (93.56%). Among the 79 species, the most reported therapeutic activities involved pregnancy and birth disorders (13.84%), followed by poisonings, infections and infestations.

In this document we will present the perception of the theory regarding Avicenna, an Islam doctor. For this we need exact moments from the movie The Doctor (2013) by Philipp Stölzl. The character «Avicenna» focus his teaching of medicine based on writings and not on experiential practices; however, when «Robert Cole» arrives at school, he brings with him knowledge based on traditional medicine and proposes to require even more knowledge from his teacher «Avicenna», he manages to get written anatomical knowledge and tends to the need to want to know what is inside. of the human body, for this reason he will carry out his first autopsy of a recently deceased human body. It is worth mentioning that autopsies were prohibited by the religion of that time. In summary, we are going to mention that indeed, yes, the autopsy of the human body was carried out in the 3rd century BC, reaching a point of agreement with the human anatomy to this day. © 2023 The Author(s).","anatomical; body; Islam; necropsy; traditional medicine","","","H.

Faced with these changes, Andean women put into practice their ancestral knowledge and attitudes to find a solution, as they are the most immediate means at their disposal. Objective: To interpret the attitudes of Andean women in the province of Hualgayoc, Peru, towards using plants for treating some gynecological events. Materials and Methods: A qualitative, exploratory, hermeneutic phenomenological design study was conducted with 16 Andean women through a semi-structured interview based on an interview guide with optimal content validity. The results emerged from open, axial, and selective coding and were organized into subcategories and categories. Results: The categories obtained were favorable attitudes towards using plants and gynecological situations for using plants. The subcategories include satisfaction with the results achieved, safety to continue using plants, aptitude to advise on the use of plants, knowledge of plant's therapeutic effects, events for using plants, and methods of preparing them. Discussion: Several international studies converge on similar attitudes, manifested in greater trust in traditional medicine, favorable acceptance behavior, belief in its effects, a mental projection of getting well, and willingness to continue its use. Conclusion: The women were satisfied with the results obtained from the use of medicinal plants because they were beneficial, indigenous to their region, and did not involve any expense. The frequent use of plants was to alleviate pain during menstruation, vaginal infections, and labor. © The authors, 2023.","Attitude; Female; Genital Diseases; Medicinal; Plants; Plants; Women; Women's Health","","","J.A.

But as cultures vary so do their approaches to healing. As cultures are time bound, so the ideas about illness, diagnosis and therapy change and this is also true for our contemporary ""scientific"" medical point of view. Here we show several traditional medicines with a special focus on the traditional Chinese medicine, but also to medical ideas from other continents and compare them with the idea of a person-centered medicine in contrast to a technicalized and standardized modern medicine. We will see that traditional medicines share as a common trait the individuality in their procedure, being all person-centered medicines. Being modest and combine the best in the efforts of healing, would fit us the most and avoid overjudging our socalled modern progress, which will never be the point of view of the day after tomorrow. The term person-centered medicine appears modernly in Western culture as a result of an ethical, philosophical and scientific reflection on the nature of health as experienced by persons, and therefore on the nature of the discipline. Person-centered medicine is practiced by human beings, is aimed at human beings and is not possible without the involvement of human beings. The medical systems that we group under the common name of traditional medicines show us numerous examples, individual and systematic, of the same comprehensive and integral approach to the person. Some of these traditional medical systems are still in full force, such as traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, Sunni medicine, and others; but from other medical systems we only preserve the remains of their time of splendor, which nevertheless are sufficient to identify the holistic character that characterized them, and that they still maintain in their contemporary versions. We will show how traditional medicines integrate the health-disease process with the psychic, the spiritual, and in many cases the family and community with the cosmic environment as fundamental aspects for medicine. The articulation of such fundamental dimensions in integrated concepts of health may be recognized in early Andean cosmovisions and more recent golden pyramid of healing perspectives. The question thus arises, if the age old traditional medicine, which existed and developped since Neanderthal times, may suggest a blueprint for person-centered medicine. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

Its leaves possess several biological activities and are commonly marketed as filters. However, despite some ethnomedicinal and pharmacological studies with Bixa orellana leaves having been published, there is a lack of review articles that collect this information. In addition, the few studies about the quality parameters of these filters must be addressed jointly so that the usefulness of existing information can be better addressed in the discussion of commercial regulation. In this way, this review aims to compile systematically useful information about the medicinal use and pharmacology of B. orellana leaves, in addition to channeling the studies on the quality parameters of filters, which in turn can define the quality, efficacy and safety of the marketed products. As a result of the review, the searches showed that the leaves of B. orellana are traditionally used for various purposes, including treatment of headache, bronchitis, and inflammation, in addition to using as a diuretic, analgesic, antiophidic, among others. Tese findings were corroborated by pharmacological studies, which also point to other biological activities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, neurodepressant and gastrointestinal modulator through the administration of leaf extracts. Finally, stability and extraction yield studies were also important in providing data for implementing quality control of B. orellana products. © 2023, Visagaa Publishing House.

Objective: To evaluate the phagocytic activity and in vivo toxicity of the aqueous extract of Schinus molle L. on Mus musculus BALB/c. Material and Methods: Experimental study that used a single dose of aqueous extract of Schinus molle leaves of 2000 mg/kg. In vivo phagocytosis was determined in 10 specimens of M. musculus BALB/c that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, which were randomly and equally distributed in the control and experimental groups. The specimens of the experimental group were inoculated intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml of Staphylococcus aureus suspension and 0.5 ml of the aqueous extract. Those of the control group were inoculated with 0.5 ml of the same bacterial inoculum and 0.5 ml of sterile saline solution. The toxicity of the extract was evaluated by the method of the acute toxicity classes in 12 specimens of mice with the same characteristics that fulfilled the same criteria applied in the evaluation of phagocytosis in vivo. Results: The results demonstrate that 57.1% of the macrophages exposed to the aqueous extract of S. molle showed significant phagocytic activity, finding an average of 21 phagocytosed bacteria per macrophage. No significant signs or symptoms of toxicity were evidenced in the specimens during the 14 days of experimentation. Conclusions: The aqueous extract of S. molle significantly increased in vivo phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages from M. musculus BALB/c, without clinical evidence of toxicity and in the absence of mortality. © 2023 Universidad de Ciencias Medicas de La Hab.

In the Amazonas region, medicinal plants use for diarrhea and fever treatment are mainly known by local or traditional names, while their phenotypic plasticity limits their proper morphological identification. Methods: In this regard, selected plants with ethnomedicinal uses in the Amazonas region were confirmed and characterized using morphology and multilocus phylogenies based on three molecular markers (ITS, matK, and rbcL). Results: This study reported four species with ethnomedicinal uses [Disciphania ernstii (Menispermaceae), Psidium fulvum (Myrtaceae), Styloceras penninervium (Buxaceae), Ugni myricoides (Myrtaceae)] distributed in humid forest, at 1,000–3,800 masl in the Amazonas region. The genetic markers that showed better resolution to distinguish species of the genera were ITS (Disciphania) and matK (Psidium, Ugni, and Styloceras). Conclusion: An initial screening regarding the diversity of plants with ethnomedicinal uses in the Amazonas region was needed and should include DNA-based techniques using these molecular markers to correctly identify them. This approach will facilitate further evaluation of the ancestral knowledge on the use of medicinal plants in Peru. © 2023, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

In the traditional medicine from Peru, L chequen is used as aromatic plant, anti-inflammatory and hypocholesterolemic. Objective: To determine the phytochemical profile, evaluate the antioxidant and the antibacterial activity of L. chequen essential oil. Material and Methods: In the analysis of the volatile components a Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify the content of terpenes and sesquiterpenes. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was the method used to determine the antioxidant activity and obtain the half inhibitory concentration (IC50). For the antibacterial activity, a colorimetric macrodilution method was carried out to evaluate the effect of the essential oil of L. chequen against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Results: The analysis by GC-MS showed two major components alpha-pinene (62.89%) followed by 1,8-cineole (11.94%), and propanoic acid, 2-methyl-, 2-methylpropyl ester with 8.67%. In the antioxidant activity against DPPH radical, the essential oil of L. chequen showed an IC50 equivalent to124.60 ± 2.0 μg/mL. In the antibacterial activity, L. chequen had an MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 of 4.35 ± 0 μg/mL and 8.71 ± 0 μg/mL respectively. Conclusion: L. chequen presented monoterpene compounds as main phytoconstituents as well as antioxidant and antibacterial activity in vitro.

Its knowledge comes from ancient generations through its expert connoisseurs, who had a broad notion of its properties, applying them properly for the prevention and treatment of various diseases. Essential oils differ from the other metabolites of medicinal plants due to their physical properties, such as density, viscosity, refractive index and optical activity. This chapter presents various medicinal species found in northern Peru that are characterized by the production of essential oils, which in turn are related to the pharmacological activity of each species. The ethnomedicinal use for all plants is presented, followed by the chemical data of the essential oil, which often proved to be peculiar when compared with the chemical characterization of the same oils collected in different regions or countries.

Scientific data for such Yawar Panga species, however, are scarce in the literature. The aim of this study was to describe the use of Yawar Panga within the context of the therapeutic community Takiwasi, in which the plant is used as part of the protocol for the rehabilitation of individuals with drug addiction. Fieldwork with experts in the administration of Yawar Panga at Takiwasi Center, as well as a retrospective qualitative analysis of experiences with this plant remedy in a residential inpatient population were performed. In-silico analysis of the main constituents of A. didyma as represented in the literature was completed in order to identify its putative pharmacological targets. The therapists interviewed consider Yawar Panga to be the most potent purga at Takiwasi and consider it especially useful in attenuating addiction withdrawal syndrome. From the patient’s perspective, this plant induces strong physical effects, and commonly precipitates effects in the oneiric and emotional dimensions. GABA B seems to be the receptor involved in the emesis induced by the phytochemicals contained in this plant species. Despite some relevant concerns related to the safety of the genus Aristolochia in modern western pharmacopoeias, some species, including A. didyma, are routinely used in the context of traditional herbal medicine in the Peruvian Amazon. Further phyto-pharmacological investigations would be helpful to elaborate this species’ medical utility, especially within the context of addiction treatment. © 2023, Visagaa Publishing House.

Even though these traditional medicinal treatments are declining since the introduction of modern medicine into the Awajun ambit, the use of traditional medicinal plants is still applied by these populations, and Awajun women, especially the elderly, are playing a vital role in preserving and transferring the remaining ecological traditional knowledge to the coming generation. Among all the medicinal plants still applied by these populations, ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) has played an important role in the health of these Awajun groups since its introduction (eighteenth century), leading even to replace native plants due to its effectiveness, and becoming the most recognized medicinal plant in the Awajun culture so far. Among all its benefits, various authors converge that ginger is considered the medicinal plant most used in childbirth and post-childbirth, or in regulating fertility in these indigenous groups. This chapter makes a compilation of different traditional uses of ginger in Awajun communities, where some of them are validated with current and promising scientific findings such as the ginger variety, Bukuchap ajeg, to reduce the menstrual flow ceases during dysmenorrhea or Akap ajeg to alleviate the different types of colic, including menstrual pain. In addition, we introduce Elsa Wajai Ampush, an Awajun traditional knowledge holder, who explains to us her interaction with this plant and its applications in different medicinal purposes besides fertility matters. Therefore, we propose to explain how this introduced plant species, ginger, has been rooted culturally in the Awajun populations so far due to its importance in health purposes that science is advancing in proving. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Amazonian indigenous populations · Awajun indigenous populations; Modern medicine; Peruvian Amazon; Shampuyacu; Traditional knowledge holder; Traditional medicinal plants; Traditional medicinal treatments; Zingiber officinale Roscoe","","","","","Springer International Publishing","","9783031150968; 9783031150975","","","English","Socio-Ecological Systems and Decoloniality: Convergence of Indigenous and Western Knowl.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159026512"

As part of an effort to ‘rural proof’ health systems, it is therefore imperative to identify and act on the factors limiting access to health services by rural and indigenous communities. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the wide range of access barriers faced by rural and remote communities in two countries where barrier assessments were conducted. It also discusses the potential for barrier assessments to contribute evidence for rural proofing of national health policies, strategies, plans and programs. Methods: The study applied a concurrent triangulation design to collect and analyze data obtained from narrative-style literature reviews, in-depth interviews with local health authorities, and secondary analyses of existing household data on Guyana and Peru. These two countries were selected because they have some of the largest rural and indigenous populations in Latin America and the Caribbean, and have national policies in place for providing free, essential health services for these communities. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected separately, and results were interpreted together. The main objective was to corroborate and cross-validate findings looking for convergence between the separate data analyses. Results: Seven dominant themes were identified across the two countries: use of traditional medicine and practice; decision making, gender, and family power dynamics; ethnicity and trust; knowledge and health literacy; geographic accessibility, health personnel and intercultural skills; and financial accessibility. The findings suggest that the interaction between these barriers may be as important as the singular role played by each factor, thereby highlighting the complex and multifactorial nature of accessing services in rural settings. Issues with limited availability of human resources for health were compounded by inadequate supplies and infrastructure. Financial barriers were often linked to the indirect costs of transport and geographic location, and further exacerbated by reduced socioeconomic status of rural communities, a majority of which are indigenous and have a strong preference for traditional medicines. Importantly, rural and indigenous communities experience considerable non-financial barriers related to issues of acceptability, which requires adaptation of health personnel and health service delivery models to the context-specific needs and realities of each rural community. Conclusion: This study presented an approach for data collection and analysis that is both feasible and effective for evaluating access barriers in rural and remote communities. While this study explored access barriers through general health services in two rural settings, the issues identified reflect the structural deficiencies of many health systems. These challenges and singularities require adaptive organizational models for the provision of health services that respond to the specific characteristics of rural and indigenous communities. This study indicates the potential relevance of conducting assessments of barriers to health services as part of a wider approach to rural proofing and supports the notion that a mixed-methods approach, linking secondary analysis of existing relevant national survey data with focused key-informant interview data, may be an effective and efficient way to transform data into the knowledge policymakers need to rural proof health policies © 2023, Rural and Remote Health.All Rights Reserved.","access; access barriers; Guyana; health equity; health policies; indigenous population; Latin America and the Caribbean; Peru; rural proofing; universal access to health; universal health coverage","article; Caribbean; data analysis; decision making; ethnicity; female; gender; Guyana; health care personnel; health care policy; health equity; health insurance; health literacy; health service; household; human; interview; male; narrative; Peru; public health; quantitative analysis; rural population; secondary analysis; skill; social status; South and Central America; traditional medicine; trust; information processing; Data Collection; Ethnicity; Health Personnel; Health Policy; Humans; Rural Population","This study was financed by the U.S. Government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under the PAHO– USAID Umbrella Grant Agreement 2016–2021.

Yet, in the Peruvian Amazon, the native region of Nicotiana rustica L., this plant is used in remarkably different manners: it is considered a potent medicinal plant, applied in liquid form for oral ingestion to treat mental health problems, a common and ancient healing practice in this region. Using a transdisciplinary field research approach with mixed ethnopsychological methods, this work aimed to report for the first time a case study in this context. The intervention took place in the Peruvian Amazon (Loreto) and involved ritual tobacco ingestion in a weeklong retreat-like frame, administered by a specialized traditional Amazonian healer. The patient was a 37-year-old woman with diagnosed mood, anxiety, and attention deficit disorders, as well as a chronic somatic condition. We applied qualitative experience-sampling during and quantitative symptom assessments pre- and post-treatment. Our findings offer a detailed description of the experiential therapeutic process during the treatment week and suggest clinically relevant improvements in patient well-being.

We present the plant and animal species used by two Ticuna communities in the Peruvian Amazon during the COVID-19 pandemic, describing the preparation and administration of the preparations. The information was obtained through semi-structured interviews with men and women from the communities during the first two waves of the pandemic, from May 2020 to June 2021. The interviews were conducted face-to-face, during fieldwork carried out in the communities, and virtual, using the telephone and messaging applications available in the communities or in the nearby major population centers. During fieldwork in Nueva Galilea, visits were made to the collection points of the plant species. Fourteen plant species and three animal species used in the pandemic were identified. The most commonly used parts of the plant species, in order of importance, were the leaves, roots, bulbs and fruits, prepared fresh, and in the form of infusions, baths, and steam inhalations. It is evident how traditional knowledge in the use of plants and animals that heal, in an integrated manner with the appropriation of external knowledge, is still vital in Ticuna communities. Knowledge about the healing properties of fourteen plant species and three identified animal species has made it possible to combat the symptoms of a very aggressive disease. © Association for Jewish Studies 2021.","COVID-19; medicinal plants; Peruvian Amazon; respiratory diseases; Traditional medicine","","","M.M.

This work evaluated the changes in GLS content and profile, derived from GLS biotransformation and myrosinase activity content, during controlled postharvest cold storage (12 °C and 80% RH) and after drying (60 °C and 1.8 m s−1). The GLS content reached its maximum value after 10 days of postharvest cold storage. The derivatives detected were 4-Methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate, 4-methoxy Benzeneacetonitrile, 4-Methoxybenzyl alcohol methyl ether, Benzyl isothiocyanate and Benzeneacetaldehyde. The processing of tubers into flour resulted in significant GLS losses of 38%–87% compared with the respective cold storage treatment. Myrosinase activity showed no correlation with the content and type of GLS and low correlation with isothiocyanates and nitriles present. Our results revealed that drying conditions must be controlled to maintain GLS concentration in the final product. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).","Cold storage; glucosinolates; isothiocyanates; myrosinase; Tropaeolum tuberosum","Drying; Tubes (components); Derived products; Glucosinolate contents; Glucosinolates; Isothiocyanates; Myrosinase; Phytochemical; Postharvest; Processing operations; Transformation products; Tropaeolum tuberosa; Cold storage","Funding text 1: This work was funded by Programa Nacional de Investigación Científica y Estudios Avanzados -PROCIENCIA through Contract No. 111-2018-FONDECYT.

The preparation is usually known to be composed of two main plants, Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, which produce both hallucinogenic and potent purging and emetic effects; currently, these are considered its major pharmacological activities. In recent decades, the psychoactive and visionary effect of ayahuasca has been highly sought after by the shamanic tourism community, which led to the popularization of ayahuasca use globally and to a cultural distancing from its traditional cosmological meanings, including that of purging and emesis. Further, the field of ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology has also produced relatively limited data linking the phytochemical diversity of ayahuasca with the different degrees of its purging and emetic versus psychoactive effects. Similarly, scientific interest has also principally addressed the psychological and mental health effects of ayahuasca, overlooking the cultural and pharmacological importance of the purging and emetic activity. The aim of this review is therefore to shed light on the understudied purging and emetic effect of ayahuasca herbal preparation.

However, its effects on reproductive physiology and male fertility have not been elucidated. Methods: Preclinical experimental study of cases and controls. Male mice with eight weeks from birth were administered orally for 70 days (two spermatogenic cycles) an aqueous extract MM: GC (n = 8) 0 mg/kg body weight (bw) control group and treated group GT (n = 8) 1000 mg/kg bw. Later the animals were euthanized, the reproductive organs were weighted, also motility and sperm count were recorded. During the days 60 or 65 of treatment, males were mated and pregnant females were sacrificed in the fourth day of pregnancy for evaluating development, quality and degree of blastulation. Results: The weights of reproductive organs did not differ significantly between the two groups (p> 0.05). However, progressive motility (32.81 vs. 15.27 ± 4.17% ± 2.08%) and sperm count (7.75 ± 0.34 x 106/ml vs. 2.56 ± 0.42 x 106/ml) decreased significantly between GC and GT, respectively. 87.5% (7/8) of the pregnant mice produced 15 litters (GC) and only 50% (4/8) of the pregnant GT yields 4 litters. However, no significant differences were found in the percentage of blastocyst stage embryos, good quality embryos, or embryos with greater than 50% the size of the embryo between the two groups (p> 0.05) blastoceles.

The aim was to study the role of dodonic acid against several protein targets of S. aureus. This study was focused on to analyse the role of dodonic acid against S. aureus target proteins such as on Sortase-A, DNA gyrase, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), clumping factor, dehydrosqualene synthase, and undecaprenyl di-phosphate synthase as a promising candidate molecule. The docking analysis of dodonic acid showed the best docking score energy on S. aureus undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase with -11.2 kcal/mol and demonstrated to be a very stable molecule at physiological conditions during the molecular dynamic for 50 ns. As conclusion, the extract demonstrated to be active against S. aureus and dodonic acid might be a promising molecule acting on the S. aureus undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase. © The Author(s) 2022.","Antibacterial; Docking Analysis; Dodoviscin; In-silico; Medicinal Plants; Molecular Dynamic","dehydrosqualene synthase; dihydrofolate reductase; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing); dodonic acid; factor A; plant extract; protein; sortase; synthetase; unclassified drug; undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase; antibacterial activity; Article; computer model; controlled study; DNA replication; Dodonaea viscosa; drug conformation; drug structure; enzyme conformation; hydrogen bond; inhibitory concentration; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; molecular model; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein function; protein structure; protein targeting; Staphylococcus aureus; zone of inhibition","","O.

Methods: Medicinal plants were collected with the help of experts, which were shown to three separate focus groups (Exchaje, La Pampilla and Yunga), whose composition was representative and decided by local authorities, who established the medicinal quality of the collected plants. For agreement analysis, two similarity coefficients were used, Jaccard (Cj) and Sørensen (Cs), and the use of the Cohen kappa Index (CKI) and Fleiss (FKI) is incorporated and proposed, for which purpose the validation of medicinal species was written in binary; statistical analysis was done using Stata 15 software. Results: Of 61 species of plant collected from experts, 36 were validated as medicinal by the focus groups, naming a total of 127 use reports. The Asteraceae are the most abundant with 18 species, followed by Lamiaceae with three, among others. The medicinal bush yareta (Azorella compacta, Apiaceae) had 11 reports of use. The predominant habit of validated medicinal species was shrub (47.2%). The so-called warm plants were the most abundant (58%) compared to the cold and temperate ones. Digestive system disorders are the category with the most reports (27). La Pampilla and Yunga presented the highest values of similarity (Cj=0.61; Cs=0.76; CKI =0.6) and the FKI showed a concordance value of 53% for the three localities. Conclusions: Traditional knowledge about medicinal plants still exists in Yunga, Moquegua. This is evidenced through the use of medicinal species identified by experts. Interesting ancestral concepts are observed around the quality of plants, about their thermal properties, such as hot, cold and temperate plants; with Digestive System Disorders being those most frequently reported. The Kappa Index is a suitable tool to show the level of agreement between localities, whose values, compared through a scale, allow greater objectivity in the analysis, in comparison with the Jaccard and Sorensen coefficients. The concordances between the evaluated localities becomes almost perfect (values closer to one) when they are influenced by factors such as their proximity, and social and cultural interrelation. © 2022, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

Here we describe a fur rubbing event in a wild coppery titi monkey (Plecturocebus cupreus) with Psychotria sp. (Rubiaceae) leaves observed and videotaped during a field study on vigilance behaviour between September-December 2019 in the Peruvian Amazon. Plants of the genus Psychotria contain a great diversity of secondary metabolites and are often used in traditional medicine. We suggest that the fur rubbing was an act of self-medication. This is the first record of fur rubbing in coppery titi monkeys in almost 4400 h of observation accumulated over more than 20 years. Copyright: © 2022 Gurjit K.

These seeds speak of the history of a people, their customs and ancestral knowledge. The general objective of the work was to evaluate the food use, crop management and traditional knowledge about the medicinal use of ancestral Andean grains among the inhabitants of the districts of Quinua and Acos Vinchos (Ayacucho-Peru). Basic descriptive research, carried out by means of convenience sampling, the sample size determined by the Law of Diminishing Returns, after signing an informed consent form. Semi-structured individual interviews were applied to 96 informants. A total of 96.9% of the informants reported that they obtained quinoa grain from their own crops, and 24.0% obtained achita grain that they sowed directly on their land; no cañihua was cultivated. A total of 58.3% use quinoa and achita in their diet. The variability of the food use of ancestral grains, specifically quinoa and achita, constitute a natural source of vegetable protein of high nutritional value, which represents one of the main foods of the inhabitants of Quinua and Acos Vinchos. Traditional medicine derived from the ancestral knowledge of Andean grains is barely preserved, but this is not the case for other medicinal plants in the area, as this knowledge is still preserved. © 2022 by the authors.

Optimization was performed by response surface methodology. CSE evaluated variables included EtOH (%), temperature, and time; UAE evaluated variables considered amplitude, time, and EtOH (%). Optimal CSE parameters were EtOH (46.3%), temperature (68.7°C), and time (62.7 min), while optimal UAE parameters were amplitude (70%), time (8.9 min), and EtOH (70%). UAE was more efficient achieving a higher PC extraction (10.4%) and higher AC (27.2%) with shorter extraction time. Thus, under optimal conditions, values of total phenolic compounds (T-PC) and AC of 182.2 mg GAE/g and 1,470.0 µmol TE/g, were obtained. The extract was mainly composed of chlorogenic acid (isomer) > rosmarinic acid > eriocitrin > naringenin. The extracts obtained are an alternative for various industrial applications. Practical applications: The Inca muña is an aromatic plant of Andean origin widely used in traditional medicine. Inca muña leaves contain a large number of phytochemicals including phenolic antioxidants, essential oils, iridoids, sterols, diterpenoids, among others. In this work, the extraction of phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity has been optimized using conventional solvent extraction and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). With both technologies, extracts with a high content of phenolic compounds are obtained, with the advantage that UAE allows to obtain better results in less time. Extracts with a high content of chlorogenic acid and rosmarinic acid were obtained. The extracts obtained from Inca muña are an alternative for the development of functional foods, nutraceuticals, and for other industrial applications. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","","Antioxidants; Essential oils; Ethanol; Flavonoids; Lipids; Phenols; Plants (botany); Ultrasonic applications; Antioxidant capacity; Chlorogenic acids; Extraction parameters; High-content; Optimisations; Phenolic antioxidant; Phenolic compounds; Polyphenols; Response-surface methodology; Rosmarinic acid; Solvent extraction","Funding text 1: This research was supported by CONCYTEC‐FONDECYT, announcement E041‐01, contract N° 065‐2018‐FONDECYT‐BM‐IADT‐AV.; Funding text 2: This research was supported by CONCYTEC-FONDECYT, announcement E041-01, contract N? 065-2018-FONDECYT-BM-IADT-AV.","D.

The Awajún People use traditional ancestral medicine based on the use of medicinal plants, which have been transmitted orally for generations. The objective of this work is to identify medicinal plants most used in Awajún communities for different ailments and to review in the scientific literature, if the pharmacological activities of their active principles explain the empirical use in each ailment. An exploratory study of descriptive scope was carried out, with a stratified sampling of 50 communities and intentional non-probabilistic choice of 100 informants Awajún. The communities are located in the departments of Amazonas, Loreto, San Martin and Cajamarca. Thirty medicinal plants (20 native plants and 10 exotic plants) were identified for 10 ailments. The plants with a significant use index for evaluation were: ginger (Zingiber officinale), cat’s claw (Uncaria tomentosa), matico (Piper aduncum), sacha garlic (Mansoa alliacea), lemon (Citrus ×limon), ojé (Ficus insipida), malva (Malachra alceifolia), toé (Brugmansia suaveolens), piri piri (Cyperus articulatus) and grade blood or dragon´s blood (Croton lechleri). Evidence has been found in the scientific literature that supports the relationship between the use and pharmacological activity of the plants most used by the Awajún communities. The use of native and exotic species in the treatment of medical ailments stands out in the ancestral knowledge transmitted. © 2022 Universidad de La Habana.

Their traditional healers called Meraya (or Onanya) are recognized in the region for their great knowledge and their deep therapeutic tradition. In this article the authors propose, based on solid ethnographic research of many years and their own experiences in the traditional medicine field, a creative, philosophical, and poetic reflection on the medicinal songs of the indigenous sages. Because both authors are registered members of the Santa Clara de Yarinacocha Native Community and members (by affinity and kinship) of a Shipiba family that has practiced traditional and visionary Amazonian medicine for many generations, the article does not apply Eurocentric methodologies or technical writing, opting instead to speak from within the Shipibo-Konibo people’s own rationalities, epistemologies, and ontologies. The authors argue that this type of writing allows them to give an account of ancestral knowledge with greater fidelity to the words of the wise men and to express in a more profound way the rich poetic heritage of the ancestors. This methodological perspective seeks to contribute to the formation of an intercultural indigenous academy. © 2022, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

On the other hand, Aedes aegypti is the main vector of several tropical diseases and the transmitter of yellow fever, chikungunya, malaria, dengue, and Zika virus. In this study, the aim was to investigate the antioxidant activity in vitro and the insecticidal activity in silico, in the presence of the mosquito juvenile hormone-binding protein (mJHBP) from Aedes aegypti, of the essential oil from S. molle leaves. The volatile phytochemicals were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the profile antioxidants were examined by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays. The evaluation in silico was carried out on mJHBP (PDB: 5V13) with an insecticidal approach. The results revealed that EO presented as the main volatile components to alpha-phellandrene (32.68%), D-limonene (12.59%), and beta-phellandrene (12.24%). The antioxidant activity showed values for DPPH=11.42±0.08 μmol ET/g, ABTS=134.88±4.37 μmol ET/g, and FRAP=65.16±1.46 μmol ET/g. Regarding the insecticidal approach in silico, alpha-muurolene and gamma-cadinene had the best biding energy on mJHBP (ΔG=-9.7 kcal/mol), followed by beta-cadinene (ΔG=-9.5 kcal/mol).

The DPPH, ABTS, FRAP in SEAF were 647 ± 3.27; 668 ± 2.30; and 575 ± 2.86 µmol TE/g, respectively, whilst LEAF showed 796 ± 3.15; 679 ± 0.85; and 806 ± 3.42 µmol TE/g, respectively. Regarding sexual behavior, LEAF showed a better effect in mount frequency, intromission frequency, ejaculation frequency, mount latency, intromission latency, ejaculatory latency, and post ejaculatory latency than SEAF. As conclusion, LEAF of J. macrantha at 50 mg/kg showed a better effect on sexual behavior in male rats with erectile dysfunction than SEAF but not higher than sildenafil. © 2021 by the authors.

Such context-specific information is prerequisite to developing evidence-based health policies and programs intended to improve health outcomes for Indigenous populations. To this end, this study aimed to characterize health-seeking behaviours, factors affecting health-seeking behaviours, and barriers to obtaining healthcare in two Indigenous Shawi communities in Peru. Methods: Community-based approaches guided this work, and included 40 semi-structured interviews and a series of informal interviews. Data were analysed thematically, using a constant comparative method; result authenticity and validity were ensured via team debriefing, member checking, and community validation. Results: Shawi health-seeking behaviours were plural, dynamic, and informed by several factors, including illness type, perceived aetiology, perceived severity, and treatment characteristics. Traditional remedies were preferred over professional biomedical healthcare; however, the two systems were viewed as complementary, and professional biomedical healthcare was sought for illnesses for which no traditional remedies existed. Barriers impeding healthcare use included distance to healthcare facilities, costs, language barriers, and cultural insensitivity amongst professional biomedical practitioners. Nevertheless, these barriers were considered within a complex decision-making process, and could be overridden by certain factors including perceived quality or effectiveness of care. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the importance of acknowledging and considering Indigenous culture and beliefs, as well as the existing traditional medical system, within the professional healthcare system. Cultural competency training and formally integrating traditional healthcare into the official healthcare system are promising strategies to increase healthcare service use, and therefore health outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s).","Health-seeking behaviour; Healthcare access; Indigenous; Intercultural health; Intercultural healthcare; Peru; Shawi","article; communication barrier; constant comparative method; cultural competence; decision making; health care access; health care facility; health care utilization; human; human experiment; Peru; semi structured interview; traditional medicine; validity; health care delivery; health care policy; Hispanic; patient attitude; qualitative research; Delivery of Health Care; Health Policy; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Qualitative Research","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the International Development Research Center of Canada’s International Research Initiative on Adaptation to Climate Change, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia grant, and a grant from the Rivers Foundation through the Scientific Exploration Society.

Solanum mammosum L. (Solanaceae) (“teta de vaca”) is used in traditional medicine in Peru to treat fungal infections and respiratory disorders via topical application. However, the mechanism of action remains unknown, particularly in light of its chemical composition. Materials and methods: The antifungal activity of TDV was determined against Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Candida albicans using bioautography-TLC-HRMS to rapidly identify the active compounds. Then, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the fruit crude extract and the active compound was determined to precisely evaluate the antifungal activity. Additionally, the effects of the most active compound on the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and pyocyanin production were evaluated. Finally, a LC-HRMS profile and a molecular network of TDV extract were created to characterize the metabolites in the fruits' ethanolic extract. Results: Bioautography-TLC-HRMS followed by isolation and confirmation of the structure of the active compound by 1D and 2D NMR allowed the identification solamargine as the main compound responsible for the anti-Trichophyton mentagrophytes (MIC = 64 μg mL−1) and anti-Candida albicans (MIC = 64 μg mL−1) activities. In addition, solamargine led to a significant reduction of about 20% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation. This effect was observed at a very low concentration (1.6 μg mL−1) and remained fairly consistent regardless of the concentration. In addition, solamargine reduced pyocyanin production by about 20% at concentrations of 12.5 and 50 μg mL−1. Furthermore, the LC-HRMS profiling of TDV allowed us to annotate seven known compounds that were analyzed through a molecular network. Conclusions: Solamargine has been shown to be the most active compound against T. mentoagrophytes and C. albicans in vitro. In addition, our data show that this compound affects significantly P. aeruginosa pyocyanin production and biofilm formation in our conditions. Altogether, these results might explain the traditional use of S. mammosum fruits to treat a variety of fungal infections and respiratory disorders. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bioautography; Candida albicans; LC-HRMS; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Solamargine; Solanum mammosum; Trichophyton mentagrophytes","antifungal agent; antiinfective agent; beta-solamarine; plant extract; pyocyanine; Solanum alkaloid; Arthrodermataceae; biofilm; Candida albicans; chemistry; drug effect; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Solanum; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antifungal Agents; Biofilms; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Plant Extracts; Pyocyanine; Solanaceous Alkaloids","The authors acknowledge the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development and the Federal University of Toulouse for research support, the infrastructure, incentive, and collaboration.

The dependent variable was HRU (Yes/No) as the main reason for not going to health care facilities. We collected these variables: age, sex, education, marital status, ethnicity, region of residence, chronic diseases or disability, and health insurance. The HRU prevalence was associated with older participants, who lived in the highlands or the jungle, belonged to Quechua or Aymara ethnic groups, and had comprehensive health insurance. In contrast, there was a lower HRU prevalence for those enrolled in private insurance.

Aims: To evaluate the in vivo bronchodilator activity of the ethanolic extract of the stems of J. macrantha. Methods: The powdered material of the stem of J. macrantha was extracted with ethanol 96° by maceration; then, the phytochemical screening was carried out. The doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg of the extracts were subjected to in vivo evaluation in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) with 1% histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, determining the latency period and the intensity of the effect. Results: Phytochemical sieving showed alkaloids, catechins, flavonoids, tannins and terpenes. The activity was observed at the three doses of the J. macrantha extract, being higher at a single dose of 400 mg/kg, with a latency period of 33.0 ± 1.02 s, asphyxia 84.5 ± 1.08 s and anaphylaxis 105.6 ± 0.59 s. The analysis of variance and Dunnett's test resulted with p<0.05 as statistically significant. Conclusions: The results showed bronchodilator activity of the ethanolic extract of J. macrantha at an average dose of 400 mg/kg, orally, in Cavia porcellus. © 2021 Academic Association of Pharmaceutical Sciences from Antofagasta (ASOCIFA).

Methodos:This is a qualitative study on social representations based on the interpretive paradigm and through an in-depth interview, for which a guide of topics or categories was used, based on the objectives of the study. The study population was made up of patients treated in the Endocrinology Units of the Antonio Lorena and Regional Hospitals of Cusco, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and of Quechua origin evidenced by their mother tongue. The sample is non-probabilistic for convenience, the representativeness of the discourse was sought for this, reaching 30 interviews based on the saturation criterion. The information analysis included 1. The transcription (from oral Quechua to written Quechua) and the translation of the interviews and 2. The computerized processing of the interviews, for which purpose the RQDA (Research qualitative data analysis) computer program was used. Results: The ideas that patients have about the cause of their disease and the changes that it produces reflect the influence of Modern Medicine and Andean and Popular Medicine.

At present, no healing drug is available in the market. Researchers are doing their best to produce drugs to fight the disease. Various efforts are being considered based on different directions of scientific knowledge and technologies for the treatment of the disease. Unfortunately, none of these drugs works absolutely against the pandemic. Therefore, bioactive molecules from plants, animals and microorganisms could be a better option to treat COVID-19. Objective: Review the literature about species of the flora of Peru used for the treatment of respiratory diseases and highlight the plants with potential in the production of secondary metabolites and plant lectins as an alternative against COVID-19. Methods: A review was conducted of scientific articles related to the use of traditional medicine in Peru, China, and India for the treatment of respiratory diseases, as well as information about plant lectins and secondary metabolites potentially useful against COVID-19. Results: A long list is presented of genera and species of the flora of Peru with great potential against COVID-19. Most of these species belong to the Asteraceae, Loranthaceae, Piperaceae, Viscaceae and Zingiberaceae families. Numerous species are endemic to Peru. Conclusions: The flora of Peru has more than 22 000 plant species. Many of these species are traditionally used in the treatment of respiratory diseases and are potentially useful for the treatment of COVID-19. © 2021, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

The lack of information or little knowledge about the effects of Allium cepa L. on skin lesions, specifically burn wounds, arouses interest in studying its effects on these skin disorders. Objective: This study assessed the wound healing activity of Allium cepa L. on second-degree burns induced in Holtzman rats. Method: Thirty-two albino rats were randomly distributed into four groups of 8 rats each, including the Healthy group, the Control group, the Experimental group (Allium cepa L.), and the Standard group (1% silver sulfadiazine). Burn wounds were induced, and topical treatments were performed daily for 21 days. The reduction of the burned body area (mm2) was determined during the experimental time. Albino rats were sacrificed with an excess of surgical anesthesia to obtain tissue samples for histopathological analysis. Results: Standard and experimental groups significantly reduced burned body area (p<0.01) compared to the control group. Histopathological studies showed hyperemic chorion in the Control group, fibroblasts, and collagen in the Standard group, and dermis composed of a reticular stratum of fibroblasts, collagen, and few blood vessels in the Experimental group. Conclusion: Allium cepa L. revealed wound-healing activity on burns induced in Holtzman rats and reduced the damage produced by burns. © 2021, Universidad de Antioquia.

Powdered seahorse not only represents the main material for the preparation of remedies in either TCM or folk medicine but is also being used to facilitate smuggling and avoid customs authorities in different countries. Here, we present the first primer set and standardized real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) protocol designed for a fast, accurate, sensitive, and reliable identification of one of the most threatened fish species in the world, the Pacific seahorse Hippocampus ingens, using DNA traces from powdered material. Our protocol efficiently detected quantities as low as 0.85 pg of seahorse DNA, showing a high specificity even in the presence of DNA from other non-target fish species. The qPCR protocol reported herein may be utilized as a powerful tool to monitor the illegal domestic trade and international trafficking of H. ingens, not only in poaching hotspot countries such as Ecuador and Peru but also in transit and final market destinations such as Hong Kong and China. In addition, we show photographic evidence of seahorse extraction and trade in northern Peru and southern Ecuador, highlighting the need for increased efforts to protect the Pacific seahorse. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Mitochondrial; Peru; Poaching; Seahorse; Traditional Chinese medicine; Wildlife","fish; molecular ecology; nature conservation; poaching; traditional medicine; wildlife management; China; Hong Kong; Hippocampus ingens; Varanidae","We wish to thank Peter Teske (University of Johannesburg) for his useful comments on H. kuda complex and Yuri Hooker (Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia) for his valuable help during the identification of pipefish samples.

Yet, it also risks undesired outcomes for conservation, animal welfare, and public health. Although it is prohibited in urban markets, the wildlife trade in Peru is poorly monitored, and practiced openly. To identify those species most likely to be affected, we investigated the trade in live wild animals and their derivatives at the Belén Market, and additional smaller open-air markets, which together make Iquitos the largest and most important wildlife trade hubs in the Peruvian Amazon. Specifically, we asked what wild animals or animal products were most profitable, what were they used for, and which wild animals were perceived by vendors to have increased most in rarity. Vendors provided 44 local animal names, from which we inferred an estimated 205 species. Nine per cent (n = 19) of these inferred species are categorised on the IUCN Red List as threatened; 35% (n = 71) are categorised as declining. We found that wild meat/food was the most frequently stated purpose of sale of wildlife, followed by pets, spiritual/belief-based use, traditional medicine, and decorative use. The most commonly cited most profitable wildlife derivatives were ‘lowland paca’, ‘yellow footed tortoise’, and ‘collared peccary’. A significant positive correlation was found between the most profitable species and those that are becoming increasingly rare. Further research focused on the actual impacts on wildlife, the socio-economic importance of this trade, the societal pressures driving consumer demand, and the risks to public health is warranted. © 2021","Belén market; Exotic pets; Illegal wildlife trade; Traditional medicine; Wild-meat","","Hani R.

There is, therefore, a need to better understand context-specific Indigenous understandings of health in order to design culturally appropriate health services. To this end, this study characterized two Shawi communities' understandings of what it means to be healthy. Using a community-based participatory research approach, 40 semi-structured interviews and a series of informal interviews were conducted and analysed thematically, using a constant comparative method. The Shawi definition of health extended beyond individual physical welfare and focused on emotional, collective, and environmental wellbeing. The primary factors underlying Shawi perceptions of health and wellbeing included providing for the family, ensuring the welfare of others, maintaining positive social relationships, preserving traditional values and practices, and living harmoniously with the natural environment. Conversely, Shawi classified illnesses according to their cause or treatment. These included illnesses caused by sorcery, those caused by spirits of the forest, and ‘new diseases,’ that first appeared in the communities when they were contacted by the Western civilization, for which no traditional remedies existed. Consequently, according to Shawi, sociocultural, environmental, and climatic changes are posing imminent health threats. This study highlights the differences between biomedical and Indigenous Shawi health understandings, and therefore emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and embracing Shawi culture and beliefs within the formal healthcare system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Health beliefs; Indigenous; Peru; Public health; Shawi","health belief; health services; indigenous population; public health; Article; awareness; case report; cassava; climate change; clinical article; comprehension; constant comparative method; Cyperaceae; emotionality; female; fever; headache; health care cost; health care personnel; health care system; human; male; participatory research; perception; population growth; qualitative research; religion; semi structured interview; social determinants of health; social interaction; social network; social support; thematic analysis; traditional medicine; welfare; wellbeing; witchcraft; Amazonia; Peru","We express our immense gratitude to the families of the two Shawi communities for welcoming the researchers into their communities and homes.

The aim of present review article was to analyze the broad spectrum of the coronavirus coexisting in Chiropterans hosts. Bats have certain types of cell receptors that allow them to be the potential hosts of a large number of viruses without the presence of any clinical manifestations, and to be a source of contagion infections for other animals and human species. Emphasis can be placed on five coronaviruses, such as Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Disease, Severe Acute Diarrhea Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2, which have had significant impacts causing epidemic outbreaks in different parts of the world, and generating implications for both human and animal health. In conclusion, recent research indicated the importance of bats as potential hosts of multiple coroaviruses leading to some zoonotic diseases. © 2021.

Pers. ""carqueja"" is a species native to South America. The best-known synonyms are B. trimera and B. crispa, used mainly against diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal and liver problems. The objective of this review is to collect information on its uses in traditional medicine, phytochemical composition, and pharmacological studies. Method: 104 papers, 5 books and 11 theses were obtained from different scientific databases and search engines, referring to Baccharis genistelloides and 13 synonyms, between 1996 and 2020, mainly in English. Results: B. genistelloides is traditionally used in diabetes and obesity. More than 107 compounds have been found in its essential oil, with carquejil acetate as the main compound. 12 flavonoids, 8 clerodan diterpenes and 5 derivatives of caffeoylquinic acid have been reported. The most studied pharmacological activities are the antioxidant capacity and the antibacterial effect. Conclusions: Carquejil acetate is the phytochemical marker for B. genistelloides. Rutin, quercetin, β-pinene, α-humulene and trans-caryophyllene have pharmacological activity. It is necessary to carry out pharmacological studies to support its traditional use in diabetes and obesity. © 2021, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

The goal of the project is to assess treatment outcomes and understand the therapeutic mechanisms of an Ayahuasca-assisted, integrative treatment model for addiction rehabilitation in the Peruvian Amazon. The proposed intervention protocol highlights the significance of treatment setting in the design, delivery, and efficacy of an addiction rehabilitation program that involves the potent psychedelic tea known as Ayahuasca. After describing the context of the study, we put forth details about our mixed-methods approach to data collection and analysis, with which we seek to gain an understanding of why, how, and for whom this specific ayahuasca-assisted treatment program is effective across a range of outcomes. The ATOP protocol employs qualitative research methods as a means to determine which aspects of the setting are meaningful to clients and practitioners, and how this may correlate with outcome measures. This paper delineates the core principles, methods, and measures of the overall ATOP umbrella, then discusses the role of ATOP in the context of the literature on long-term residential programs. To conclude, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the protocol and the intended future of the project. © Copyright © 2021 Rush, Marcus, García, Loizaga-Velder, Loewinger, Spitalier and Mendive.","ayahuasca; outcome; substance use; traditional medicine; treatment","Article; Banisteriopsis caapi; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; clinical protocol; drug delivery system; drug dependence; drug efficacy; drug potency; hallucinogenic plant; human; nonhuman; Peruvian; study design; treatment outcome","Funding text 1: Fourth, and last, the research protocol aims to identify strengths, challenges and limitations within the current Takiwasi treatment model so as to contribute to ongoing efforts toward quality improvement.

Methods Study with a mixed approach, of a qualitative nature, by conducting oral, uns-tructured interviews on the use and curative properties of the pacha-muña to 10 informal women workers, from the rural villages of Antajirca and Bomboncocha, district of Churu-bamba. And with a quantitative approach, since wild plants were collected, to submit their leaves to ethanol extraction, and expose the extract to qualitative tests such as: Shinoda, ferric chloride, foam test, by Fehling; among others. The technique of steam distillation was also applied to extract the essential oil, which was subjected to gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Results Pacha-muña, a plant widely used by the inhabitants of the region, is consumed as an infusion to cure digestive problems (diarrhea, heartburn, halitosis, indigestion, colic), respiratory diseases (flu, bronchitis, asthma), among others. It was found that the leaves are mainly composed by: flavonoids, tannins, phenols and pulegone. Conclusion Pacha-muña is an aromatic herb widely used by the inhabitants of Huánuco as a cultural inheritance of high medicinal value, with healing effects explained by the presence of flavonoids, tannins, phenols and pulegone. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

In rural areas of the Loreto region, home to indigenous populations such as the Kukama-Kukamiria, birth takes place at home constantly. This study aims to understand the preference for home births as well as childbirth and newborn care practices among Kukama-Kukamiria women in rural Loreto. Following a case study approach, sixty semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with recent mothers who experienced childbirth within one year prior to the interview, female relatives of recent mothers who had a role in childbirth, male relatives of recent mothers, community health workers, and traditional healers. We found that for women from these communities, home birth is a courageous act and an intimate (i.e. members of the community and relatives participate in it) and inexpensive practice in comparison with institutional birth. These preferences are also linked to experiences of mistreatment at health facilities, lack of cultural adaptation of birthing services, and access barriers to them. Preparations for home births included handwashing and cleaning delivery surfaces. After birth, waiting for the godparent to arrive to cut the cord can delay drying of the newborn. Discarding of colostrum, lack of skin-to-skin contact as well as a range of responses regarding immediate breastfeeding and immediate drying of the baby were also found. These findings were used to tailor the educational content of the Mamas del Rio program, where community health workers are trained to identify pregnancy early, perform home visits to pregnant women and newborns, and promote essential newborn care practices in case institutional birth is not desired or feasible. We make recommendations to improve Peru's cultural adaptation of birthing services. © 2021 Del Mastro N. et al.

However, there is few documented information about the practical aspects of their use and few scientific validation. The starting point of this work was a set of interviews of people living in six rural communities from the Peruvian Amazon (Alto Amazonas Province) about their uses of plants from Piper genus: one community of Amerindian native people (Shawi community) and five communities of mestizos. Infections caused by parasitic protozoa take a huge toll on public health in the Amazonian communities, who partly fight it using traditional remedies. Validation of these traditional practices contributes to public health care efficiency and may help to identify new antiprotozoal compounds. Aims of study: To record and validate the use of medicinal Piper species by rural people of Alto Amazonas Province (Peru) and annotate active compounds using a correlation study and a data mining approach. Materials and methods: Rural communities were interviewed about traditional medication against parasite infections with medicinal Piper species. Ethnopharmacological surveys were undertaken in five mestizo villages, namely: Nueva Arica, Shucushuyacu, Parinari, Lagunas and Esperanza, and one Shawi community (Balsapuerto village). All communities belong to the Alto Amazonas Province (Loreto region, Peru). Seventeen Piper species were collected according to their traditional use for the treatment of parasitic diseases, 35 extracts (leaves or leaves and stems) were tested in vitro on P. falciparum (3D7 chloroquine-sensitive strain and W2 chloroquine-resistant strain), Leishmania donovani LV9 strain and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Assessments were performed on HUVEC cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. The annotation of active compounds was realized by metabolomic analysis and molecular networking approach. Results: Nine extracts were active (IC<inf>50</inf> ≤ 10 μg/mL) on 3D7 P. falciparum and only one on W2 P. falciparum, six on L. donovani (axenic and intramacrophagic amastigotes) and seven on Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Only one extract was active on all three parasites (P. lineatum). After metabolomic analyses and annotation of compounds active on Leishmania, P. strigosum and P. pseudoarboreum were considered as potential sources of leishmanicidal compounds. Conclusions: This ethnopharmacological study and the associated in vitro bioassays corroborated the relevance of use of Piper species in the Amazonian traditional medicine, especially in Peru. A series of Piper species with few previously available phytochemical data have good antiprotozoal activity and could be a starting point for subsequent promising work. Metabolomic approach appears to be a smart, quick but still limited methodology to identify compounds with high probability of biological activity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","antiprotozoal Activity; Leishmania; Metabolomic; Peruvian amazon; Plasmodium; Trypanosoma","antiprotozoal agent; chloroquine; herbaceous agent; Piper extract; unclassified drug; antimalarial agent; plant extract; amastigote; animal cell; antileishmanial activity; antiplasmodial activity; antiprotozoal activity; Article; bioassay; CC50 (cytotoxic concentration); community; controlled study; correlational study; data mining; drug cytotoxicity; ethnopharmacology; genus; human; human cell; HUVEC cell line; IC50; in vitro study; interview; Leishmania; Leishmania donovani; leishmanicidal activity; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; macrophage; medicinal plant; metabolomics; mouse; nonhuman; parasitosis; Peru; phytochemistry; Piper (plant); Piper lineatum; Piper pseudoarboreum; PIper strigosum; Piperaceae; plant leaf; plant stem; Plasmodium falciparum; RAW 264.7 cell line; rural population; selectivity index; species; tandem mass spectrometry; traditional medicine; Trypanosoma brucei gambiense; animal; drug effect; ethnology; female; isolation and purification; Mesocricetus; metabolism; procedures; questionnaire; umbilical vein endothelial cell; Animals; Antimalarials; Antiprotozoal Agents; Ethnopharmacology; Female; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Medicine, Traditional; Metabolomics; Mice; Piper; Plant Extracts; RAW 264.7 Cells; Surveys and Questionnaires","Funding text 1: The authors thank the Consejo de Ciencia y Tecnología del Perú (CONCYTEC) (Council for science and technology of Peru) (299 - 2014 - FONDECYT) for the PhD scholarship (PG V–O).

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the scare treatment based on shamanic ritual from a previous description of the diagnostic characteristics of this cultural syndrome. Methods: Two phases were designed: one to analyze the object of study and propose an explanatory model of the characteristics of the scare as a cultural syndrome and another phase to elaborate a model that would allow to know the therapeutic efficacy of shamanism. The population consisted of 50 inhabitants of the District of Morrope, who presented the scare cultural syndrome, with attendance to shamanic rituals. Results: An etiology caused by stressful events affecting functionality and quality of life was found, with symptoms such as: lack of mood, anorexia, body pain, sleep disorder, nocturnal fear and body tremor; symptoms such as anxiety, abnormal beliefs (harm, witchcraft), sleep disorders, including nightmares, with episodes lasting 1-3 weeks, were also found. Different phases of a strategy for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the scare treatment were proposed, which included the application of psychological instruments in subjects attending shamanic rituals. Conclusions: The scare presented a particular symptomatology that is assumed to be dependent on territory and culture, achieving to evidence that shamanism presents an efficacy for its treatment. © Este material es publicado según los términos de la Licencia Creative Commons Atribución–NoComercial 4.0.

The solution provides assignments of outpatient medical consultations that are notified in real time to the closest health specialists in order to arrange a home health visit. In Peru, the waiting time for medical attention is 82 minutes and the average time for scheduling the appointment is 80.04 minutes in clinics or private health centers. This delay causes many patients to seek self-medication or use traditional medicine or simply do not attend to treat their medical emergency. The proposal uses the technique of using the K-means algorithm and the Ant Colony System algorithm and it has 3 components: Physical Architecture, Cloud Services and Technologies, languages and frameworks. The validation was carried out with a sample of 10 specialist physicians in Lima, Peru. Preliminary results allowed the technique used to reduce the waiting time to 70.85% and the appointment scheduling time was reduced by 95.55%. These percentages are calculated in reference to the data evaluated in 2020 by the INEI. © 2021 IEEE.","Geolocation; Health care systems; Home visits","Ant colony optimization; Home health care; K-means clustering; Appointment scheduling; Geolocations; Health centers; Healthcare systems; Home health; Home visit; Real- time; Routing techniques; Technological solution; Waiting time; Scheduling","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9781665407052","","","English","Proc.

Objetive: The aim of the study was to test the potential effects of aqueous extract of Red Maca (AQ-RM) on antidepressant-like behavioral in male rats and spatial memory in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Methods: Forced swimming test was used to examine the potential antidepressant AQ-RM activity in male rats. Fluoxetine and amitryptiline were included as reference drugs. Morris Water Maze test was employed to examine the effect of AQ-RM on spatial memory in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Such effects were compared to exogenous estradiol administration. The potential role of oxidative stress on spatial memory loss was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in rats brain homogenates. Results: AQ-RM enhances swimming and climbing activities while reducing the time of immobility in male rats. Meanwhile, it prevents the decrease in the time spent in the target quadrant and displays higher values in the number of crossings in OVX-rats as compared to OVX-control rats. MDA levels in brain homogenates were decreased in OVX-rats receiving AQ-RM. Conclusion: Oral administration of AQ-RM has anti-depressive application in male rats; and increases the ability of learning and memory in OVX rats. © 2021 Phcogj.Com.

One of the plant medicines from TAM used in this protocol is purgahuasca. It is a decoction of the vine Banisteriopsis caapi alone, whose use is traditional among the Awajún and other ethnic groups in Peru. The research began with a field trip to Awajún territory to explore the indigenous use of purgahuasca as an initiation rite. Then, analysis of its application was conducted in the clinical context of Takiwasi. Open-ended and semi-structured interviews with Awajún informants and Takiwasi’s therapeutic staff were performed and analyzed following the narrative methodological approach. Further clinical data on the ingestion of purgahuasca by Takiwasi’s SUD patients were obtained from the internal repository. These indicate that 359 (92.1%) patients reported having had the so-called mareación (dizziness), 299 (76.7%) experienced physical sensations, and 208 (53.3%) had visions. These effects can be related to the psychoactivity of β-Carbolines alkaloids from B. caapi, a medicinal plant that seems to have potential benefits also for SUD, especially giving a key contribution to the patients’ therapeutic process of becoming aware of the personal reasons behind addictive behaviors. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Awajún medicine; ayahuasca; Banisteriopsis caapi; purgahuasca; substance use disorder (SUD); β-Carbolines","Article; Banisteriopsis caapi; child; cosmos; drug dependence; female; herbal medicine; human; major clinical study; male; psychotherapy; religion; school child; semi structured interview; visual hallucination; Banisteriopsis; medicinal plant; traditional medicine; alkaloid; plant extract; Alkaloids; Humans; Medicine, Traditional; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Substance-Related Disorders","","M.

Yet, in the Peruvian Amazon, the geographical region believed to be tobacco’s historical birthplace, this plant is associated with a strikingly different usage and repute: Tobacco (especially Nicotiana rustica L.) in this area is described as a potent medicinal plant, used topically or via ingestion to treat a variety of health conditions. The goal of this transdisciplinary field study was to investigate clinical applications of the tobacco plant as per Amazonian medicine exemplified in the practice of a reputed Maestro Tabaquero, an Amazonian traditional healer whose medical specialization focuses on tobacco-based treatments. Methods: Using a transdisciplinary clinical approach, we conducted in-depth interviews with the tabaquero applying the systematizing expert interview method, in order to map modes of preparation and administration, indications, contraindications, effects, risks, adverse effects, and systemic aspects of tobacco-based remedies. Results: The informant’s descriptions revealed refined knowledge on this plant’s therapeutic properties and scope, safety profile, and application techniques. The main indications mentioned included “problems of the mind,” of the respiratory system, parasitic illnesses (intestinal/skin), gout, and Amazonian epistemic conditions described as spiritual-energetic in nature. A liquid remedy taken orally was his most commonly used preparation, with acute/sub-acute effects involving a pronounced psychoactive component (altered state of consciousness) and physiological response (emesis, nausea). A skilled tabaquero that knows how to dose, administer, and intervene in case of adverse effects was considered imperative for safe treatment delivery. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study employing a transdisciplinary clinical approach to examine therapeutic applications of tobacco by an Amazonian tabaquero. Our findings significantly contribute to the growing research literature on Amazonian medicine and emergent psychedelic-assisted therapies and could, in the long-term, open new treatment avenues in several domains. Forthcoming studies should assess toxicity/safety and clinical outcomes of patients receiving Amazonian tobacco-based treatment. © Copyright © 2020 Berlowitz, Torres, Walt, Wolf, Maake and Martin-Soelch.","Amazon; medicinal plant; Nicotiana rusticaL; Peru; psychedelic-assisted therapy; psychoactive; tobacco; traditional medicine (TM)","adverse event; Article; controlled study; health hazard; human; interdisciplinary research; long term care; medicinal plant; mental health; professional knowledge; psychosomatics; safety; smoking; tobacco use; traditional healer; traditional medicine","This research was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation as part of a Spark grant (SNF-190428).

During several decades, the Rhinella horribilis toad was confused with the invasive toad Rhinella marina, a species documented with extensive toxinological studies. In contrast, the chemical composition and biological effects of the parotoid gland secretions (PGS) remain still unknown for R. horribilis. In this work, we determine for the first time 55 compounds from the PGS of R. horribilis, which were identified using HPLC-MS/MS. The crude extract inhibited the proliferation of A549 cancer cells with IC<inf>50</inf> values of 0.031 ± 0.007 and 0.015 ± 0.001 µg/mL at 24 and 48 h of exposure, respectively. Moreover, it inhibited the clonogenic capacity, increased ROS levels, and prevented the etoposide-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the effect of R. horribilis poison secretion was by cell cycle blocking before of G2/M-phase checkpoint. Fraction B was the most active and strongly inhibited cancer cell migration. Our results indicate that the PGS of R. horribilis are composed of alkaloids, bufadienolides, and argininyl diacids derivatives, inhibiting the proliferation and migration of A549 cells. © 2020 by the authors.

It was aimed to share and evaluate investigators' experiences on challenges and opportunities on clinical research and pharmacogenetics. Methods: A total of 33 members from 22 countries participated in 2 sessions: RIBEF studies on population pharmacogenetics about the relationship between ancestry with relevant drug-related genetic polymorphisms and the relationship between genotype and phenotype in Native Americans (session 1) and case examples of clinical studies in RLSs from Asia (cancer), America (diabetes and women health), and Africa (malaria) in which the participants were asked to answer in free text their experiences on challenges and opportunities to solve the problems (session 2). Later, a discourse analysis grouping common themes by affinity was conducted. Findings: The main result of session 1 was that the pharmacogenetics-related ancestry of the population should be considered when designing clinical studies in RLSs. In session 2, 21 challenges and 20 opportunities were identified. The social aspects represent the largest proportion of the challenges (43%) and opportunities (55%), and some of them seem to be common. Implications: The main discussion points were gathered in the Declaration of Mérida/T'Hó and announced on the Parliament of Extremadura during the CIOMS-RIBEF meeting in 4 of the major Latin American autochthonous languages (Náhualth, Mayan, Miskito, and Kichwa). The declaration highlighted the following: (1) the relevance of population pharmacogenetics, (2) the sociocultural contexts (interaction with traditional medicine), and (3) the education needs of research teams for clinical research in vulnerable and autochthonous populations. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","CIOMS-RIBEF; clinical research; pharmacogenetics; resource-limited settings","clinical pharmacology; clinical research; Conference Paper; discourse analysis; drug research; ethnicity; genetic polymorphism; genotype phenotype correlation; human; international organization; pharmacogenetics; symposium; Africa; Asia; diabetes mellitus; genetics; genotype; health care planning; malaria; medical research; neoplasm; phenotype; United States; women's health; American Natives; Biomedical Research; Diabetes Mellitus; Genotype; Health Resources; Humans; Malaria; Neoplasms; Pharmacogenetics; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Genetic; Women's Health","The meeting was organized by CIOMS and RIBEF in collaboration with Junta de Extremadura (Foreign Affairs General Direction), the Parliament of Extremadura, the Extremadura Agency for International Development Cooperation AEXCID, PHI Foundation, and the University of Extremadura.

In ethnopharmacology, a sub-field of ethnobotany, there is a concerning lack of ethnographic methods reported in the literature. The ethnographic approach is essential for detailing traditional methods of preparation and administration of plant medicines, yet pharmaceutical researchers overemphasize western epistemologies of medicinal discovery and production. In the present work, we propose an ethnopharmaceutical survey as a model to investigate the culturally recognized standards necessary for the formulation of herbal medicines. Fieldwork based on participant observation and semi-structured interviews examined the modes of preparation employed by traditional healers in the Amazonian region of San Martín, Peru. The authors draw on anthropological insight into plural epistemological encounters and propose an ethnopharmaceutical approach that takes seriously the Amazonian methods and perceptions for the preparation of traditional plant medicines. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anthropology; Ethnopharmacology; human plant interactions; Peruvian shamanism; traditional Amazonian medicine","adult; anthropology; article; ethnopharmacology; field work; herbal medicine; human; perception; Peru; semi structured interview; Shamanism; traditional healer; ethnobotany; medical anthropology; medicinal plant; traditional medicine; plant medicinal product; Anthropology, Medical; Ethnobotany; Ethnopharmacology; Herbal Medicine; Humans; Medicine, Traditional; Plant Preparations; Plants, Medicinal","","O.

Recently, it has gained importance as an alternative to conventional treatment. Several extracts of plants and fruits have been recently evaluated for their potential activity against microorganisms involved in the development of dental caries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and antiadherent effect of the crude organic extract (COE) and three partitions (aqueous, butanolic, and chloroformic) of Psidium guajava (guava) leaves on a cariogenic biofilm model. Materials and methods: Guava leaves were obtained from the mountains of northern Peru, where they grow wild and free of pesticides. The antimicrobial activity of the COEs and partitions against Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus gordonii was determined by measuring the inhibition halos, while the effect on biofilm adhesion was determined by measuring the optical density using spectrophotometry. Results: An antibacterial effect of the COE and chloroformic partition against S. gordonii (p < 0.05) was found, as was a significant effect on biofilm adherence, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.78 mg/mL, which was maintained throughout the 7 days of evaluation. Conclusion: We conclude that the COEs and their chloroformic partition have antimicrobial and antibiotic effects against this strain of S. gordonii, making them of particular interest for evaluation as a promising alternative for the prevention of dental caries. Clinical significance: By knowing the antimicrobial effect of Psidium guajava, this substance can be effectively used in products aimed to prevent dental caries and periodontal disease. © The Author(s).","Cariogenic biofilm; Dental caries; Psidium guajava; Streptococcus gordonii; Streptococcus mutans","antiinfective agent; biofilm; dental caries; human; Peru; plant leaf; Psidium; Anti-Infective Agents; Biofilms; Dental Caries; Humans; Plant Leaves","1Vice-Rectorate for Investigation, Universidad Alas Peruanas, Lima, Perú 2,3Bacteriology Laboratory, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Perú 4,5Department of Oral Rehabilitation, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú 6,7Biopolymers and Metallopharmaceuticals Research Laboratory, Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria, Lima, Perú 8Department of Oral Rehabilitation, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Perú 9Faculty of Medical Sciences, Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Lima, Perú Corresponding Author: Pablo A Millones-Gómez, Vice-Rectorate for Investigation, Universidad Alas Peruanas, Lima, Perú, Phone: +51 944908425, e-mail: pablodent@hotmail.com How to cite this article: Millones-Gómez PA, Maurtua-Torres D, Bacilio-Amaranto R, et al.

A close attention was paid to the medical context and plant therapy, leading to the selection of 35 plant species (45 extracts). The extracts were tested for antiviral activity against HCV with counting of Huh-7 cellular death in case of toxicity, and cytotoxicity was evaluated in HepG2 cells. Aim of the study: The aim of the study was to inventory the plants used against hepatitis in Loreto, then to evaluate their antiviral activity and to suggest a way to improve local therapeutic strategy against viral hepatitis, which is a fatal disease that is still increasing in this area. Materials and methods: An ethnographic survey was carried out using “participant-observation” methodology and focusing on plant therapy against hepatitis including associated remedies. 45 parts of plant were extracted with methanol and tested in vitro for anti-HCV activity in 96-well plate, using HCV cell culture system with immunofluorescent detection assisted by automated confocal microscopy. Toxicity of plant extracts was also evaluated in microplates on hepatic cells by immunofluorescent detection, for the Huh-7 nuclei viability, and by UV-absorbance measurement of MTT formazan for cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. Results: In vitro assay revealed interesting activity of 18 extracts (50% infection inhibition at 25 μg/mL) with low cytotoxicity for 15 of them. Result analysis showed that at least 30% of HCV virus were inhibited at 25 μg/mL for 60% of the plant extracts. Moreover, the ethnomedical survey showed that remedies used with low and accurate dosing as targeted therapy against hepatitis are usually more active than species indicated with more flexible dosing to alleviate symptoms of hepatic diseases. Conclusion: Together with bibliographic data analysis, this study supported the traditional medicinal uses of many plants and contributed to a better understanding of the local medical system. It also permitted to refine the therapeutic plant indications regarding patients’ liver injuries and vulnerability. Only 2 of the 15 most active plant species have already been studied for antiviral activity against hepatitis suggesting new avenues to be followed for the 13 other species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Antiviral activity; Hepatitis C; Medicinal plant; Peru; Traditional use","plant extract; antivirus agent; antiviral activity; Arecaceae; Article; Aspidosperma; Aspidosperma excelsum; Asteraceae; Astrocaryum jauari; avocado; Bignoniaceae; Bixa orellana; Caesalpinia pulcherrima; Carludovica palmata; Cecropia; Cecropia ficifolia; Chamaesyce thymifolia; Costus; Costus erythrocoryne; Crescentia cujete; cultural factor; Curcuma longa; Cyperaceae; Desmodium adscendens; Eryngium foetidum; ethnobotany; Euphorbiaceae; Euterpe; Euterpe precatoria; Fabaceae; Gossypium barbadense; Gynerium sagittatum; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; human; Hura crepitans; in vitro study; Jatropha curcas; Malachra ruderalis; Malvaceae; Mansoa alliacea; Maytenus; Maytenus macrocarpa; medicinal plant; nonhuman; Oenocarpus bataua; papaya; Peru; Phyllanthus; Phyllanthus stipulatus; Phyllanthus urinaria; Physalis angulata; Phytelephas macrocarpa; phytochemistry; pigeonpea; Pouteria; Pouteria caimito; Pseudelephantopus spiralis; Scleria microcarpa; Senna; Senna reticulata; traditional medicine; virus hepatitis; chemistry; drug effect; ethnopharmacology; Hep-G2 cell line; Hepacivirus; isolation and purification; phytotherapy; rain forest; virology; Antiviral Agents; Ethnopharmacology; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatitis C; Humans; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Rainforest","Members and contributors of the scientific humanitarian association ARPIA (Association for Research on Indigenous Amazonian Pharmacopeia); F.M.

While the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD, Rio 1992) has been recognized as a huge step forward, the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol (NP) and of new forms of collaboration often remain unresolved, especially in the context of “the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources” (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2011). The vision and the specific implementation of this international treaty vary from country to country, which poses additional challenges. Aims: Using a case study approach, in this analysis we aim at understanding the specific opportunities and challenges for implementing international collaborations regarding ABS in six Latin American countries—Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, México, Panama, and Peru. Based on that analysis, we provide recommendations for the path ahead regarding international collaborations under ABS agreements in ethnopharmacological research. Results and Discussions: The implementation of the NP varies in the six countries; and while they are all rich in biodiversity, access and benefit sharing mechanisms differ considerably. There is a need to engage in a consultation process with stakeholders, but this has often come to a halt. Institutional infrastructures to implement national policies are weak, and the level of knowledge about the NP and the CBD within countries remains limited. Conclusions: Different policies in the six countries result in very diverse strategies and opportunities relating to the equitable use of biodiversity. A long-term strategy is required to facilitate a better understanding of the treaties and the resulting opportunities for a fairer development and implementation of transparent national polices, which currently differ in the six countries. So far, the benefits envisioned by the CBD and the NP remain unfulfilled for all stakeholders involved including local communities. © Copyright © 2020 Heinrich, Scotti, Andrade-Cetto, Berger-Gonzalez, Echeverría, Friso, Garcia-Cardona, Hesketh, Hitziger, Maake, Politi, Spadafora and Spadafora.","Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS); benefit sharing; biological resources; Nagoya Protocol; natural products; traditional medicine","Article; consultation; ethnopharmacology; health care access; health care policy; human; intersectoral collaboration; Japan; national health service; practice guideline; risk factor; South and Central America","","","","Frontiers Media S.A. info@frontiersin.org","16639812","","","","English","Front.

Although they are widely used for food, traditional medicine and the object of many studies for their cultivation and industrialization, only the species Pomacea maculata is mentioned in the literature. Molecular identification was carried out based on the mitochondrial marker COI of individuals of ""churo negro"" apple snails (Pomacea) commercialized in the markets of Iquitos, as well as those used in restaurant dishes in the city of Lima, and contrasted with specimens from their natural habitat. It was found that these specimens, correspond to the species Pomacea nobilis (Reeve, 1856). The molecular phylogenetic analysis showed P. nobilis as the sister species of P. guyanensis, in the P. glauca group, distantly related to P. maculata. The uncorrected distances found between them, for the mitochondrial marker COI, were from 11.33% to 13.17%, while with P. maculate were from 13.67% to 15.33%. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the DNA barcode for the identification and authentication of the species, which gives it added value for its eventual export trade. © Los autores.","Amazonia; Ampullariidae; Apple snails; Authentication; COI; DNA barcoding; Molecular identification; Molecular phylogeny; Species identification; Taxonomy","","","R.

It is considered a species of great genetic diversity and in this study we evaluated the nutritional characteristics, fatty acids profile, antioxidant compounds and antioxidant activities of three kañihua ecotypes from Peru named “Chilliwa” (light grey seeds), “Planta púrpura” (light orange seeds) and “Red kañiwa Condorsaya” (red seeds). These ecotypes of kañiwa were characterized by their high content of carbohydrates (65.5-68%), proteins (14.7-15.5%) and fat (7.6-8.5%). In relation to fatty acids, linoleic acid was determined as the major component (45.8-49.6%), followed by oleic acid; while linolenic acid was found in smaller proportion (5.7 – 6.8%). The content of total phenolics and total flavonoids were found between 1.4 – 1.9 mg-eq gallic acid/g and 1.5-2.0 mg-eq catechin/g, respectively. Betalains content was found between 2.3 and 42.0 mg/100 g. Antioxidant activities, measured as the concentration of sample extract (EC<inf>50</inf>) that decreases by 50% the initial DPPH radical concentration, ranged from 1.3 to 4.2 mg extract/mL. The kañihua ecotypes “Chilliwa” (light grey seeds), “Planta púrpura” (light orange seeds) and “Red kañiwa Condorsaya” (red seeds) are important sources of protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids. ""Red Cañihua"" and ""Purple Plant"" ecotypes also showed a high content of betacyanins and betaxanthines and good antioxidant activity, which supports the use of these Andean grains as functional foods. © 2020, SILAE (Italo-Latin American Society of Ethnomedicine).

The objective of this review is to provide scientific information that supports the therapeutic properties of barberry such as Berberis vulgaris. Methods: Information was searched in scientific databases, Plantlist, Scopus, PubMed, Google Academic and repositories of university theses on, ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological information and compared with Berberis rigida Hieron, Berberis vulgaris, Ilex guayusa Loes, Vellesia glabra (Cav), since all of them also have the common name of barberry. Results: Currently there are 3 families and 4 genera that present a species known as barberry, 5 Peruvian university theses in the last 10 years that address the utilities of the genus Berberidaceae and its species, having the most useful tincture. The greatest scientific information, 1,363 studies between ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological, support the usefulness of B. vulgaris, although they come from eastern countries and only 3 are Peruvian. Conclusions: The information that supports the usefulness of B. vulgaris (barberry), comes from international publications (Iran, Pakistan), in addition, there is no Peruvian ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological scientific information, this generates a risk of species confusion, even more so if it has the same common name, and similar phytotherapeutic characteristics. These two situations would lead to the adoption of information from other countries, which in turn puts at risk of possible ineffectiveness of treatment with traditional medicine.

The research approach is qualitative, ethnographic and phenomenological, the population of study were elderly people who know about prevention and healing of the prostate with isaño. The technique of semi-structured interview was used to obtain information from the field. The result reveals that the wild isaño or pajarillu is the tuber that fulfills the healing role of the prostate of people suffering from the disease and is not the cultivated isaño, which only fulfills the role of prevention. It is concluded that many people with prostate disease were healed by healers based on the pajarillu isaño. © 2020, Universidad de Tarapaca.

The aim of this study was to investigate the acute and sub-acute toxicity of tocosh flour (TF). For sub-acute toxicity, TF was administered orally to rats daily once a day for 28 days at doses of 1000 mg/kg body weight (BW). Animals were observed for general behaviors, mortality, body weight variations, and histological analysis. At the end of treatment, relative organ weights, histopathology, hematological and biochemical parameters were analyzed. For acute toxicity, TF was administered orally to mice at doses of 2000 and 5000 mg/kg BW at a single dose in both sexes. Body weight, mortality, and clinical signs were observed for 14 days after treatment. The results of acute toxicity showed that the median lethal dose (LD<inf>50</inf>) value of TF is higher than 2000 g/kg BW but less than 5000 mg/Kg BW in mice. Death and toxicological symptoms were not found during the treatment. For sub-acute toxicity, we found that no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAEL) of TF in rats up to 1000 g/kg BW. There were statistically significant differences in body weight, and relative organ weight in the stomach and brain. No differences in hematological and biochemical parameters were observed when compared with the control group. For sub-acute toxicity, histopathological studies revealed minor abnormalities in liver and kidney tissues at doses of 5000 mg/Kg. Based on these results, TF is a traditional Peruvian medicine with high safety at up to 1000 mg/kg BW for 28 days in rats. © 2020 by the authors.","Fermented foods; Oral toxicity; Solanum tuberosum L; Tocosh; Traditional medicine","","","O.

In the Peruvian traditional medicine, the latex of the plant is used for the treatment of wounds, inflammation, ulcers, and other ailments. This study aims to evaluate the wound healing effect of the latex of H. sucuuba in BALB/C albino mice. Materials and Methods: Thirty BALB/C male mice were used for wound healing study. In the experimental procedures, wound skin incision was performed at 2.0 cm in length until subcutaneous on the paravertebral of each animal. Under locally anesthetized with procaine cream, the treatment was conducted. All the mice were divided into three groups, the control group (A), zinc oxide cream (B), and H. sucuuba latex (C). The entire surface of the wound was treated for all the groups, and the treatments were performed daily for 15 days. The experiments were stopped on days 1, 7, and 15, respectively. Results: The histopathological study of tissues revealed significant changes in wound healing effect in H. sucuuba latex compared to the control and B groups. Consequently, the mice treated with latex showed a significant reduction in epithelialization time and collagen formation. Furthermore, the latex showed a dose-dependent significant reduction of inflammation in the first 24 h of treatment. Conclusion: BALB/C mice treated with the latex of H. sucuuba possess a wound healing effect that can scientifically prove the traditional use of the plant as a wound healing agent. © 2020 Limited Liability Company KlinMed Consulting.

The present study evaluates the impact of integrating ayahuasca and TAM with psychotherapy on depression and anxiety in an inpatient addiction treatment program. Male patients (N = 31) were evaluated pre and post treatment using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, motivation, quality of life, spirituality, and treatment satisfaction were also measured and analyzed by means of two tailed t-test, one way ANOVA and Spearman test. From pre- to post-treatment, patients showed significant reductions in scores of anxiety (from 20.8 to 11.6, p < .002) and depression (from 18.7 to 7.5, p <.001). Similarly, patients showed higher scores of quality of life (p < .001) and spirituality (p < .001) upon discharge, which correlated with their reduction in scores of anxiety and depression. While future results will evaluate the efficacy of this treatment on measures of addiction at follow-up, the present results build upon previous research to bring further support to the use of Ayahuasca and Amazonian medicine in mental health treatments with a transpersonal focus. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Addiction comorbidities; anxiety; ayahuasca; depression; psychotherapy; traditional medicine","alcohol; cannabis; cocaine; opiate; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; Banisteriopsis caapi; Beck Anxiety Inventory; Beck Depression Inventory; clinical article; conservative treatment; depression; drug dependence; follow up; human; male; mental health; observational study; patient satisfaction; pilot study; psychotherapy; quality of life; questionnaire; substance use; treatment duration; anxiety; Banisteriopsis; middle aged; motivation; procedures; psychological rating scale; religion; residential care; symbolism; traditional medicine; young adult; Adult; Anxiety; Ceremonial Behavior; Depression; Humans; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Motivation; Pilot Projects; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychotherapy; Quality of Life; Residential Treatment; Spirituality; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult","","C.

Acmella ciliata (known in Brazil as jambu) is a native herb of South America, used in regional gastronomy and folk medicine in Amazonas-Brazil, has antibacterial properties, and may be a useful host for bioactive endophytes. We isolated endophytic microorganisms from A. ciliata and evaluated their ability to inhibit pathogenic fungi. We isolated 56 fungi and 39 endophytic bacteria, most of them from the leaves. The endophyte isolates were then tested in antagonism assays against the phytopathogens Fusarium decemcellulare and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The best antagonism index values against C. gloeosporioides were obtained with the endophytic fungus UEA-253 (40%), and the endophytic bacterium UEA-135 (46.3%). The highest antagonism index values were obtained against F. decemcellulare with the fungus UEA-234 (47.2%), and the bacterium UEA-135 (44.8%). The endophytic fungi with inhibitory bioactivity belong to the genera Curvularia, Colletotrichum, Plectosphaerella and Sordariomycetes, while the endophytic bacteria belong to the genera Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Enterobacter. We conclude that the endophytic fungi and bacteria isolated from A. ciliata have potential for use in the biocontrol of F. decemcellulare and C. gloeosporioides. © FUNPEC-RP.","Biocontrol; Colletotrichum gloeosporioides; Fungus; Fusarium decemcellulare; Phytopathogen","Amazonas (Brazil); antibacterial activity; antifungal activity; article; Asteraceae; Bacillus; biological activity; biological pest control; ciliate; controlled study; Curvularia; endophytic fungus; Enterobacter; Fusarium; Glomerella cingulata; microorganism; nonhuman; phytopathogen; plant leaf; Pseudomonas; traditional medicine","The authors are thankful to José Alan Párraga Condezo for support on technical and statistical analyses.

Kirchn, grows wild in the tropical Andes, humid and mountainous landscapes. Traditionally, it is used to treat various health problems; however, the lack of systematic information with scientific rigor that corroborates its pharmacological effects, causes potential problems that would affect the population who uses the plant, either due to a phytotherapeutic failure or the appearance of adverse effects. Therefore, this review aims to gather and analyze available information about Argyrochosma nivea on ethnobotanical, ethnopharmacological and phytochemical aspects. Methods: Data collection of Argyrochosma nivea was carried out using Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Biblioteca Virtual-CONCYTEC databases; In addition, Google-Academic search engine was used. The search terms were ""Argyrochosma nivea"", ""Notholaena nivea"" or ""cuti cuti"". Results: The use of the plant in traditional medicine is varied; for example, to treat diabetes, infectious conditions, inflammatory diseases, pain relievers and even for a toxic effect (abortifacient). Preliminary studies to evaluate the hypoglycemic, antibacterial and antioxidant effects are evident; in addition, 10 compounds were isolated from the plant. Conclusions: Available information of the plant was gathered and analyzed, structuring them in ethnobotanical, ethnopharmacological and phytochemical aspects.

Both species have several common names, being ""pasuchaca"" the most used name to refer to them; this could lead to identity confusions and even adulteration problems. Therefore, this review aims to analyze and contrast medicinal use with the pharmacological effects, in order to identify the scientific gaps on these two plant species. Methods: Relevant information was obtained through systematic searches, in databases such as Scopus, ScienceDirect and PubMed. In addition, information from primary sources not covered by them, such as thesis repositories, was included. According to geographical distribution, botanical aspects, traditional use, phytochemical, ethnopharmacology and toxicity information was analyzed and organized. Results: 20 studies about these plants, the majority ethnobotanicals, were reported. The plant, fresh or dried, is used in decoction or infusion. The use of Geranium ayavacense as hypoglycemic and antibacterial, has more evidence; while Geranium sessiliflorum was studied for its antibacterial activity. However, there are scientific gaps regarding other therapeutic properties conferred on them by traditional medicine. Conclusions: In spite of the scarce available scientific information, these plants are widely used, a situation that could even put the health people at risk; therefore, it is essential to carry out deeper studies, with a phytochemical, pharmacological and toxicological approach. © Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

Five strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections from patients with respiratory tract infections and Musa acuminata liquid extract will be used. The number of experimental observations was 75 for the inhibitory effect and 120 for the toxicity. The inhibitory effect was determined following the sowing methodology by the method of surface extension and the bioassay of toxicity with Artemia saline nauplii. At volumes of 5.10, 20, 30% v / v of banana sap, 6.3x106 were obtained; 4.3x106; 2.3x106 and 0 CFU / mL respectively, the difference between them was statistically significant. Musa acuminata extract (banana var. Silk) on Artemia saline determined an average ratio between the exposure concentration and the LC50 of 22,553% v / v (2,255 mL), which is relatively harmless. It is concluded that the extract of Musa acuminata (banana var.

Although there is an abundance of treatment options, many of these rehabilitative trajectories are subject to “drop-out”. In addition, “drop-out” is a significant risk factor for relapse. There is an urgent demand for effective treatment, which would enable patients to reduce abuse and prevent relapse. Takiwasi is an addiction treatment centre that combines traditional Amazonian plant medicine with conventional western medicine and psychotherapy. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether socio-demographics factors, such as education level and occupation, psychiatric comorbidities and primary drug use, are associated with treatment non-completion of Ayahuasca (AYA)-assisted addiction therapy. Design/methodology/approach: Data on the first treatment episode of 121 patients were collected from the patient database from the years 2012 to 2017. To determine whether there is an association between the variables of interest and treatment non-completion, a χ2 analysis and a logistic regression analysis were performed. Findings: Of the 121 patients analysed, 48.2 per cent completed their treatment, whilst 51.8 per cent did not. Students compared to those who are employed showed significantly higher odds for treatment non-completion (p=0.006; OR=3.7; 95% CI=1.5–9.6). Other variables in the multivariable analysis showed no significant relationship with treatment non-completion. While several limitations restricted the study, the findings suggest that the AYA-assisted treatment in Takiwasi may benefit from additional support for patients who are students. Moreover, it is advised to conduct more long-term follow-up of patients in order to gain better insight into the outcome of treatment at an AYA-assisted treatment centre. Originality/value: It appears that AYA-assisted therapy in a therapeutic community is a feasible type of treatment for addiction, for which further studies should elucidate the role of motivation in relation to socio-demographic factors and type of addiction in the risk of treatment non-completion. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Inpatient; Substance dependence; Substance use treatment; Therapeutic communities; Traditional medicine; Treatment drop out","","","M.

Substance use disorder (SUD), as a chronic psychosomatic illness, might benefit from a similar approach. The accredited Takiwasi Center offers such an SUD treatment program involving Amazonian medicine combined with psychotherapy. The current study assessed this integrative program‘s short-term therapeutic effects. We measured baseline data from 53 dependence-diagnosed males admitted to treatment (T1) and repeated clinical outcome variables at treatment completion (T2). Paired samples t-tests were used to assess changes between T1 and T2 (n = 36). Nearly all participants (age M= 30.86, SD= 8.17) were dependent on multiple substances, most prominently cannabis, alcohol, and cocaine-related drugs. A significant decrease (T1 to T2) was found for addiction severity outcomes drug use (p <.001), alcohol use (p <.001), psychiatric status (p <.001), and social/familial relationships (p <.001). Emotional distress also diminished significantly (p <.001), as did substance craving (p <.001). Quality of life increased significantly from T1 to T2 (p <.001). Our results provide first indications for significantly improved SUD symptoms after the Amazonian medicine-based treatment. These findings are preliminary given the design, but strongly encourage further investigation of this therapy, which in the long term may open new therapeutic avenues for SUDs. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","addiction treatment; alternative medicine; Amazonian medicine; ayahuasca; drug abuse; Substance use disorder","alcohol; cannabis; cocaine; alcoholism; Amazonian medicine; Article; cannabis addiction; clinical outcome; cocaine dependence; drug craving; drug dependence; drug dependence treatment; emotional stress; human; major clinical study; male; outcome variable; psychotherapy; quality of life; short course therapy; therapy effect; traditional medicine; adult; clinical trial; multimodality cancer therapy; procedures; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Combined Modality Therapy; Humans; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Psychotherapy; Substance-Related Disorders; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation [SNSF-148981].

Aims of the study: (1) To compare patterns of the distribution of TK for a human group living between two ecoregions: high tropical montane forests vs. low tropical montane forests; (2) to understand the TK at the gender level; and (3) to analyse TK transmission over five generations. Material and methods: The study was conducted in two ecoregions, four areas and 12 localities. We gathered information with 600 participants through semi-structured interviews. We worked with 3–7 expert informants per locality using the “walk in the woods” methodology for gathering ethnomedicinal information in the field. We annotated local vernacular names, medicinal indications, and collected the plants in their habitats. Then we interviewed the rest of the participants in their homes. To evaluate significant differences between highlands and lowlands, we use general mixed linear models test and its corresponding post hoc LSD Fisher test of multiple comparisons (p < 0.05) at ecoregion, gender and generation level. Results: A total of 416 species belonging to 107 plant families and 13,898 use-reports were found in both ecoregions. Overall, significant differences indicated that people in the highlands had higher TK than people in the lowlands for most of the medicinal categories. Women showed higher knowledge on medicinal plants in all medicinal categories and areas in both ecoregions. However, transmission of TK showed different patterns between ecoregions. In the highlands, the TK increased from the youngest to the senior group (51–60 years), with a slight decreasing for those over 60 years, whereas in the lowlands the findings were less clear and generations with highest TK were divergent across localities. Conclusion: TK on medicinal plants is still widely applied in the tropical montane forests of northern Peru. The localities with less prosperous socioeconomic development (highlands) were the areas with higher TK on medicinal plants. Women are mainly the depositories of the traditional medicine. The older generations maintain most of the TK in the highlands, whereas in the lowlands the TK is more widespread across generations. Future conservation programs on medicinal plants should understand who are the generations depositaries of the TK before dedicate any effort. © 2019","Altitudinal range; Folk medicine; Gender balance; Mestizo phytotherapy; Transmission of traditional knowledge","adult; Article; biogeographic region; Bixa orellana; coca; female; gender; human; Lamiaceae; lemon; male; Matricaria recutita; medicinal plant; nonhuman; Passiflora; Physalis; Ruta chalepensis; Rutaceae; semi structured interview; Solanaceae; traditional medicine; tropical rain forest; adolescent; altitude; attitude to health; comparative study; forest; middle aged; Peru; phytotherapy; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Altitude; Female; Forests; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Phytotherapy; Plants, Medicinal; Young Adult","We express our sincere gratitude to the 600 informants who shared their time and knowledge with us and to the political and communal representatives of the localities that permitted the study.

Methods: We performed a community-based needs assessment adapting Demographic and Health survey methodology with additional questions determining female health literacy on cervical cancer and assessing the availability and need for cervical cancer screening services. We surveyed women (N = 121) across all households in six communities along the Lower Napo River, Loreto, Peru, in May 2015. Data were collected as part of the larger Amazon Community Based Participation Cervical Cancer Screen-and-Treat Programme. Survey data were compared to national results from ENDES 2014. Results: Comparison between our findings and the ENDES 2014 survey highlighted considerable inequality between indigenous or mixed indigenous, rural populations in Loreto, Peru, and national population data averages over level of formal education, literacy, barriers to accessing healthcare and maternal and sexual health. Even though only 5.9% (N = 7/117) of women had no formal health insurance coverage, money was reported as the leading barrier accessing healthcare (N = 88/117, 75.2%). Health literacy regarding cervical and breast cancer was poor. A high proportion of women highlighted fear of screening processes (70.8%, N = 80/113) and lack of available services (53.6%, N = 60/112) as barriers to cervical cancer screening. Conclusion: Although progress has been made in improving healthcare access in Peru, such gains have not been experienced equitably and women living in remote communities face persistent marginalization regarding their health. There is a significant need for education related to and screening for cervical cancer in this region that is tailored to the reality of women’s lives in remote communities in Loreto. © The Author(s) 2019.","Amazon; cervical cancer; inequality; non-communicable diseases; Peru; prevention; screening","adult; aged; Article; attitude to health; breast cancer; cancer screening; comparative study; dental health; descriptive research; educational status; family planning; female; health auxiliary; health care access; health care need; health care practice; health education; health insurance; health literacy; health service; health survey; household income; human; major clinical study; maternal care; maternal welfare; middle aged; outcome assessment; participatory research; population size; sexual health; traditional medicine; uterine cervix cancer; early cancer diagnosis; epidemiology; ethnology; health care delivery; mass screening; needs assessment; Peru; socioeconomics; uterine cervix tumor; young adult; Adult; Aged; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Literacy; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Young Adult","","G.

Herbalists shared information about species they use in cancer treatment, including common names, part of the plant used, methods of preparation, plant state, and frequency and method of administration as medicine. We combined this information with the Shannon-Wiener diversity and evenness index to complete a quantitative analysis of the anticarcinogenic species. Our results demonstrate that 46 different species representing 24 genera and 19 families are locally used in cancer treatment, with a Shannon-Wiener index of 3.6 and 0.9 respectively.

(Apiaceae) is an endemic shrub from Chile commonly used as infusion in traditional medicine to treat diabetes, bronchial and intestinal disorders and stomach ailments, including ulcers. From the EtOAc extract of this plant, the new mulinane-type diterpenoids 3 and 5 were isolated along with three known diterpenoids. The gastroprotective effect of the infusion of the plant was assayed to support the traditional use and a fast HPLC analysis using high resolution techniques was performed to identify the bioactive constituents. The EtOAc extract and the edible infusion showed gastroprotective effect at 100 mg/kg in the HCl/EtOH induced gastric ulcer model in mice, reducing lesions by 33% and 74%, respectively. Finally, a metabolomic profiling based on UHPLC-ESI-MS/HRMS of the edible infusion was performed and thirty-five compounds were tentatively identified including quercetin, caffeic acid, apigenine glucoside, p-coumaric acid, chlorogenic acids, and caffeoylquinic acids, which have been associated previously with gastroprotective and antiulcer properties. This scientific evidence can support the contribution of polyphenols in the gastroprotective activity of the edible infusion of this plant, and can validate at least in part, its ethnopharmacological use. © 2019 by the authors.","Diterpenoids; Mulinanes; Mulinum crassifolium; Orbitrap; Secondary metabolites; UHPLC-MS","diterpene; mulinane; plant extract; animal; Apiaceae; chemical structure; chemistry; drug effect; gastrointestinal tract; high performance liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolome; metabolomics; mouse; Animals; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Diterpenes; Gastrointestinal Tract; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Mice; Molecular Structure; Plant Extracts","Funding: This research was sponsored by CONICYT: FONDECYT REGULAR 1170871.","B.

In order to address this problem, the Peruvian Ministry of Health has focused on improving access to primary healthcare and providing maternal and child health monitoring and education. Current maternal-child health policies in Peru introduce recommendations that are in some respect distinct from those of Indigenous highland communities. This paper analyses the similarities and differences between public health and mothers' infant feeding recommendations. Furthermore, it analyses persistence and change in those recommendations among women who were mothers before and after the introduction of current public health policies. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 older mothers, 15 currently breastfeeding mothers, and 15 public health staff in highland rural communities of Peru. During data analysis, thematic codes and text passages were used in an iterative analytic process to document emerging themes. Results: The results highlight the existence of a traditional corpus of beliefs surrounding infant feeding and care that is consistent with Andean ethnomedical beliefs. This is illustrated by mother's accounts referring to the importance of maintaining a dietary balance of fluids and semi-fluids and of maintaining harmony with the elements in the natural environment. Mothers also incorporate aspects of public health recommendations that they find useful including initiating breastfeeding immediately after birth and exclusive breastfeeding up until 6months. There are also tensions between the two systems including differences in the conceptualization of breastfeeding and infant food, the imposition of public health care services by coercive means, and negative stereotyping of rural Andean diets and mothers. Conclusions: Identifying similarities and differences between distinct systems may provide useful input for effective intercultural health policies. Sources of tension should be carefully assessed with the aim of improving public health policies. Such efforts should apply a process of cultural humility engaging health care professionals in exchange and conversations with patients and communities acknowledging the assumptions and beliefs that are embedded in their own understanding. This process should also recognize and value the knowledge and practices of Andean mothers and their role as primary caretakers. © 2018 The Author(s).","Andes; Breastfeeding; Ethnomedicine; Infant feeding; Intercultural health; Public health","article; baby food; breast feeding; child health; conversation; data analysis; diet; education; female; health care policy; human; infant; monitoring; mother; Peru; primary health care; public health service; rural population; semi structured interview; staff; stereotyping; tension; traditional medicine; adult; attitude to health; comparative study; developing country; ethnology; health education; indigenous health care; interview; male; management; procedures; public health; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Attitude to Health; Breast Feeding; Developing Countries; Female; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Policy; Health Services, Indigenous; Humans; Infant; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Policy Making; Public Health; Rural Population","","M.

Despite the initial findings, no information regarding its influence on behavioral phenotype (BP) has been previously reported. Objective: The objective was to assess the effect on EB149 on BP in male mice and to perform a bioguide-fractionation aimed at the verification of the cytotoxic potential against breast and prostate cancer cell lines. Materials and Methods: BP was assessed by observation in an open cage and subsequent analysis in an open field (OF) at 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min, after intraperitoneal administration of X. aromatica, in a two-stage experimental delineation. Results: EB149 impaired general activity, piloerection, defecation, breathing, auricular and corneal reflexes, tail squeeze, response to touch, hindquarter fall, surface-righting reflex, body tone, and grip reflex in the first stage. In the second stage, general activity, tail squeeze, touch response, and breathing were impaired, and a decrease in locomotion frequency in OF was also observed. All behavioral changes were recovered during the period of experiment in both stages. The LD50 of EB149 was 1.944 g/kg. Two fractions obtained from EB149 named FSIST, which contains sitosterol and stigmasterol as major compounds, and total alkaloid fraction, which contains total alkaloids, showed cytotoxicity against breast and prostate cancer cell lines. Conclusions: The traditional plant X. aromatica EB149 organic extract showed cytotoxicity against breast and prostate cancer cell lines and the recovery of behavioral impairment related to general activity, tail squeeze, touch response, breath, and locomotion frequency, causing no harm to male lab mice. © 2018 Pharmacognosy Magazine | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Annonaceae; antiproliferative; behavioral phenotype; cytotoxicity; Xylopia aromatica","cytotoxic agent; doxorubicin; plant extract; sitosterol; stigmasterol; unclassified drug; Xylopia aromatica extract; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; auricular reflex; behavior change; body tone; breathing; controlled study; cornea reflex; cytotoxicity; defecation; grip reflex; hindquarter fall; human; human cell; in vivo study; LD50; locomotion; male; mouse; nonhuman; open field test; reflex; surface righting reflex; tail squeeze; touch response; traditional medicine; Xylopia; Xylopia aromatica","The authors wish to thank Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo–FAPESP for Grant #2008/58706‑8.","I.B.

Although effective animal and human vaccines have been available for over 100 years, control efforts have not been adequately implemented on the global scale and rabies remains one of the greatest global zoonotic threats to human health. We conducted a knowledge, attitudes and practices survey in Northern Cameroon to describe dog ownership characteristics, rates of dog bites, and post-bite healthcare seeking behaviors. Methods The survey was performed in four rural Cameroonian communities. A structured community-based questionnaire was conducted over a 20-day period in April 2010, and focused on socio-economic factors correlated with gaps in rabies knowledge. Information pertaining to socio-demographics, as well as attitudes and practices with regard to animal bites and bite treatment practices were recorded. Characteristics of dog ownership such as dog confinement, resources provided to dogs, and dog vaccination status were examined. Human to dog ratios were compared on a linear scale to poverty scores by community. When applicable, 2-tailed Chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests were calculated to determine relationships between variables. We also used One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to identify associations between rabies knowledge and wealth with dog ownership, dog vaccination, and human healthcare seeking behaviors. Independent variables were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 208 households were enrolled. Respondents were predominantly male (68.3%), with a median age of 43.6 years. Eighty-four households (39.9%) reported owning a total of 141 dogs (human dog ratio 10.4:1). The majority of dogs (61%) were allowed to roam freely. A history of rabies vaccination was reported for 30.8% of owned dogs. Respondents reported 11 bites during the two years preceding the survey (annual bite incidence was 2.6% [95% CI 1.4%– 4.6%]). Only one person (9.1%) received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and none described symptoms of clinical illness consistent with rabies. Respondents who indicated that they would seek medical care and PEP after a dog bite had higher average wealth and rabies knowledge index scores (p = 0.01 and 0.04, respectively). Respondents who indicated that they would seek care from a traditional healer had significantly lower wealth scores, but not significantly different knowledge scores (p < 0.01 and p = 0.49, respectively). Conclusions In the communities evaluated, the majority of dogs were allowed to roam freely and had no history of rabies vaccination; factors that favor enzootic transmission of canine rabies virus. We also identified a strong relationship between poverty and dog ownership. Bite events were relatively common among respondents, and very few victims reported utilizing health services to treat wounds. Increased wealth and knowledge were significantly associated with increased likelihood that a respondent would seek medical care and post-exposure prophylaxis. These findings indicate the need for educational outreach to raise awareness of dog rabies and proper prevention measures. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

The traditional healer was the first practitioner consulted by 45.2% of people with epilepsy. Sixty-six species have been mentioned by the people with epilepsy and traditional healers on the treatment of epilepsy. Carbamazepine was the most prescribed anti-epileptic drug with 33.2% of prescriptions. Conclusions This study was the first to measure a percentage of use of herbal medicine for epilepsy in Peru. It would be interesting to conduct a pharmacological evaluation of the most commonly used species on epileptic models to validate and secure their use. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Botany; Central nervous system; Epilepsy; Medicinal plants; Peru; Quality traditional medicines; Therapeutic strategy; Traditional medicine Meso- and Southern America; WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy","anticonvulsive agent; carbamazepine; herbaceous agent; Article; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; epilepsy; ethnopharmacology; herbal medicine; human; medicinal plant; observational study; Peru; adult; classification; female; phytotherapy; rural population; traditional medicine; Adult; Anticonvulsants; Cross-Sectional Studies; Epilepsy; Female; Herbal Medicine; Humans; Medicine, Traditional; Phytotherapy; Plants, Medicinal; Rural Population","This work was supported by the Limousin Region as part of a thematic call for project “Health and Nature products” and the diagnosis of epilepsy was carried out by an earlier study founded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ( 23981 ).","A.

Yet, in spite of its global relevance, current treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) is still not entirely successful. The purpose of this study was to investigate alternative treatments and conceptions from traditional Amazonian medicine adapted to SUDs. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 practicing experts at a well-established addiction treatment center in the Peruvian Amazon and performed qualitative content analysis on the collected data. Main categories were deductively defined and corresponding subcategories inductively developed. Results: Our findings revealed characteristic features and consequences, causes and antecedents, and treatment methods of SUDs as the main categories. Overall, concepts of disease etiology bore resemblance with contemporary biopsychosocial models of SUDs. The Amazonian therapeutic means however differed markedly from current Western ones. The main methods involved dietary retreats, healing ceremonies, and purging rituals. The integral application of Amazonian methods, as well as their traditional implementation according to prescribed ritual protocols, were emphasized by the experts as crucial for efficacy and safety of treatment delivery. Conclusion: We suggest further scientific attention to these therapies, including clinical studies, for which our results provide conceptual underpinnings. Findings from this research expand the crosscultural understanding of SUDs and, in the long run, may enhance its treatment options. © 2018, Associacao Brasileira de Psiquiatria.

Despite this trend, few studies have been conducted to report HM practices of patients with a hepatic tumor in the developing world. Hence, this study aimed to document the use of HM among patients with liver cancer in Peru. Study Design and Methods: A comparative behavioral epidemiological survey was conducted among liver cancer patients attending the National Cancer Institute of Peru. Information was obtained by direct interviews based on a semistructured questionnaire. The use of HM in Peruvian liver cancer patients was reported, first, regarding general consumption prior to the onset of disease, and second, after the appearance of symptoms that patients would relate to their tumor. In parallel, general consumption of HM in noncancerous people was assessed as a comparative figure. A correspondence analysis was performed to reveal potential associations between the symptoms of cancer and the specific use of HM. Results: Eighty-eight patients and 117 noncancerous individuals participated in the survey. Overall, 68.3% of the people interviewed claimed to use HM on a regular basis for general health preservation. Furthermore, 56.8% of the patients turned to plants first to treat the disorders for which they later came to the cancer care center. When compared with the number of plant species used routinely (n = 78), a selection of plants was made by patients in response to the symptoms of cancer (n = 46). At least 2 plant species, Aloe vera and Morinda citrifolia, were significantly associated with the treatment of liver cancer–related symptoms in the patient group. Conclusions: The present study is the first survey on the HM practices of patients with liver cancer in Latin America and, more broadly, in the developing world. Our findings confirm that HM remains one of the principal primary health care resources in Peru, even for a severe disease like liver cancer. These traditional, complementary and alternative medicine practices should be taken into consideration in Peruvian health programs aiming to educate the population in cancer prevention and treatment, as well as integrative cancer management. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","behavioral epidemiological survey; cancer; complementary and alternative medicine; developing world; ethnobotany; Indigenous people; integrative medicine; Latin America; liver disease; traditional medicine","herbaceous agent; adult; alfalfa; Aloe vera; Aloysia citrodora; anise; Annona muricata; anorexia; anxiety; aphonia; Artemisia absinthium; artichoke; Article; asthenia; Averrhoa carambola; avocado; backache; barley; basil; Bidens pilosa; Bixa orellana; bloating; body weight loss; Camellia sinensis; cancer center; carrot; celery; Chamaemelum; Chamaemelum nobile; Chenopodium ambrosioides; chicory; coca; Cucurbita pepo; Cymbopogon citratus; dehydration; depression; diarrhea; digestive system function disorder; dyspepsia; dyspnea; epistaxis; Equisetum; erythema; Eucalyptus; fatigue; female; fever; flax; garlic; Gentianella alborosea; headache; health status; hematuria; hemoptysis; herbal medicine; human; insomnia; jaundice; lemon; lifestyle; liver cancer; maize; major clinical study; male; Malus pumila; Malva; medicinal plant; Melissa officinalis; Morinda citrifolia; muscle cramp; nausea; Oenothera rosea; onion; Opuntia ficus-indica; oregano; papaya; paresthesia; parsley; passion fruit; Peperomia; Peru; Peumus boldus; Phyllanthus; pineapple; Piper (plant); Plantago; potato; priority journal; rash; rosemary; Ruta chalepensis; Salvia officinalis; Sambucus; Schinus molle; Senecio; sore throat; sour orange; Spartium junceum; symptom; Taraxacum campylodes; thyme; Tilia; Uncaria tomentosa; Urtica urens; Valeriana; watercress; alternative medicine; health care survey; integrative medicine; integrative oncology; liver tumor; middle aged; phytotherapy; procedures; professional practice; young adult; Adult; Complementary Therapies; Female; Health Care Surveys; Herbal Medicine; Humans; Integrative Medicine; Integrative Oncology; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Phytotherapy; Professional Practice; Young Adult","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: TRR was a recipient of a doctoral fellowship from Innóvate Perú (069-FINCyT-BDE-2014); JPC was a recipient of a doctoral fellowship from the Peruvian National Council for Science and Technology (212-2015-FONDECYT); ER and FD were supported by the Young Research Teams Associated with IRD Program (JEAI-INCAncer); and GB, PP, JG, ED, and SB were supported by the Third Cancer Plan of the French National Alliance for Life Sciences and Health (ENV201408).","T.

However, there is few documented information about the practical aspects of their use and few scientific validation. The starting point for this work was a set of interviews of people living in rural communities from the Peruvian Amazon about their uses of plants. Protozoan diseases are a public health issue in the Amazonian communities, who partly cope with it by using traditional remedies. Validation of these traditional practices contributes to public health care efficiency and may help identify new antiprotozoal compounds. Aims of study to inventory and validate the use of medicinal plants by rural people of Loreto region. Materials and methods Rural mestizos were interviewed about traditional medication of parasite infections with medicinal plants. Ethnopharmacological surveys were undertaken in two villages along Iquitos-Nauta road (Loreto region, Peru), namely 13 de Febrero and El Dorado communities. Forty-six plants were collected according to their traditional use for the treatment of parasitic diseases, 50 ethanolic extracts (different parts for some of the plants) were tested in vitro on Plasmodium falciparum (3D7 sensitive strain and W2 chloroquine resistant strain), Leishmania donovani LV9 strain and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Cytotoxic assessment (HUVEC cells) of the active extracts was performed. Two of the most active plants were submitted to preliminary bioguided fractionation to ascertain and explore their activities. Results From the initial plants list, 10 were found to be active on P. falciparum, 15 on L. donovani and 2 on the three parasites. The ethanolic extract from Costus curvibracteatus (Costaceae) leaves and Grias neuberthii (Lecythidaceae) bark showed strong in vitro activity on P. falciparum (sensitive and resistant strain) and L. donovani and moderate activity on T. brucei gambiense. Conclusions The Amazonian forest communities in Peru represents a source of knowledge on the use of medicinal plants. In this work, several extracts with antiprotozoal activity were identified. This work contributes to validate some traditional uses and opens subsequent investigations on active compounds isolation and identification. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Antiprotozoal activity; Ethnopharmacological survey; Leishmania; Medicinal plants; Peruvian Amazon; Plasmodium; Trypanosoma","Abrus arboreus extract; Albizia niopoides extract; Alchornea castaneifolia extract; Alchornea triplinervia extract; antiprotozoal agent; Apeiba tibourbou extract; Bauhinia herrerae extract; Campsiandra angustifolia extract; Capirona decorticans extract; Cedrela odorata extract; Cephaelis tomentosa extract; Chelonanthus alatus extract; chloroquine; Clarisia racemosa extract; Copaifera paupera extract; Costus curvibracteatus extract; Dracontium spruceanum extract; Grias neuberthii extract; Guarea guidonia extract; Gustavia angustifolia extract; Handroanthus impetiginosus extract; Handroanthus serratifolius extract; Inga sertulifera extract; Iriartea deltoidea extract; Maytenus macrocarpa extract; miltefosine; Minquartia guianensis extract; Ormosia costulata extract; plant extract; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; Abrus arboreus; Albizia niopoides; Alchornea castaneifolia; Alchornea triplinervia; animal cell; antiprotozoal activity; Apeiba tibourbou; Article; Bauhinia herrerae; Campsiandra angustifolia; Capirona decorticans; Cedrela odorata; Cephaelis tomentosa; Chelonanthus alatus; Clarisia racemosa; Copaifera paupera; Costus curvibracteatus; Dracontium spruceanum; drug cytotoxicity; Grias neuberthii; Guarea guidonia; Gustavia angustifolia; Handroanthus impetiginosus; Handroanthus serratifolius; herbal medicine; human; human cell; HUVEC cell line; in vitro study; Inga sertulifera; Iriartea deltoidea; Leishmania donovani; macrophage; Maytenus macrocarpa; medicinal plant; Minquartia guianensis; monocyte; mouse; nonhuman; Ormosia costulata; parasitosis; Plasmodium falciparum; Pouteria guianensis; Prieurella prieurii; Roucheria columbiana; rural population; Simarouba amara; Sloanea schomburgkii; Stachytarpheta cayennensis; Swartzia simplex; Tachigali polyphylla; Tessaria integrifolia; Triplaris weigeltiana; Trypanosoma brucei gambiense; Virola calophylla; animal; chemistry; drug effect; drug sensitivity; ethnopharmacology; female; hamster; isolation and purification; parasitology; Peru; procedures; protozoal infection; questionnaire; traditional medicine; umbilical vein endothelial cell; validation study; Animals; Antiprotozoal Agents; Cricetinae; Ethnopharmacology; Female; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Medicine, Traditional; Parasitic Sensitivity Tests; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Protozoan Infections; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires","The authors thank the Consejo de Ciencia y Tecnología del Perú (CONCYTEC) (Council for science and technology of Peru) ( 299 - 2014 - FONDECYT ) for the Ph.D. scholarship (PGVO).

Kuntze, Fabaceae-Mimosoideae, is a medicinal plant used in Brazil against snakebite, as healing and as insecticide. Its stem organic extract showed relevant cytotoxicity. Reports concerning alterations in behavioral phenotype are not known, nor were compounds isolated from pracaxi stem. Organic extract (EB827) were administered to Balb-c male mice and general behavioral changes related to motor, sensorial and central/autonomous nervous systems were evaluated. Both 50% lethal (LD50) and non-lethal doses (NLD) tendencies were determined. EB827 was chemically studied using partition, column chromatography and thin layer chromatography to isolate four compounds that were H1 and C13 nuclear magnetic resonance analyzed. LD50 tendency was 228.25 mg/mL for EB827 and NLD was 78.1 mg/mL. Impairment in general activity was observed, as it did in tail squeeze, response to touch, defecation, cyanosis and breath. Then, behavioral changes in general activity, response to touch, tail squeeze, defecation and breath were observed after NLD administration. Locomotion was diminished by the administration of EB827, as immobility time has increased, in the open field apparatus. Necropsy showed that mice ended up with pale liver and opaque internal organs, despite the occurrence of haemorrhage, which could have been the cause of amimals death. Friedelin, epifriedelanol, sitosterol and stigmasterol were isolated from pracaxi stem. Behavioral phenotype after administration of the organic extract of pracaxi was determined by the subsequent analyses proposed in the present work, and displays the basis of further pharmacological studies. Also, four molecules were described to occur in the stem of the plant for the first time. © 2017, SILAE (Italo-Latin American Society of Ethnomedicine).

Using medicinal plants for the prevention of chronic diseases such as cancer constitutes new alternatives in traditional medicine. Oenothera rosea (OR) could be an option, but it needs to be evaluated. Aim: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of OR extract on N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU)-induced GC in rats. Methods: In total, 80 male Holtzman rats were randomized into five groups. Group A received the saline solution (5mL/kg), group B received NMU 500 μg/kg (cancer inductor) by oral administration for 16 weeks, and groups C, D, and E were treated with OR extract (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg, respectively) and NMU in order to evaluate the preventive effect on cancer induced by NMU for 16 weeks. Blood and histological samples of stomachs were collected to determine histopathological, biochemical, and hematological parameters between different experimental groups. Results: Groups C, D, and E presented less histopathological changes such as anaplastic and hyperplastic cells, compared with group B. Hematological and biochemical parameters were recorded, and superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide levels were statistically less than those of NMU group (P<0.05, P<0.01, and P<0.01). Conclusion: Considering the histopathological signs and the antioxidant activity in vivo as well as hematological and biochemical parameters of ethanolic extract of OR, we concluded that its administration in rats has a protective effect on GC, which is induced experimentally. This species could be studied in clinical trials for patients with GC in the future. © 2017 Almora-Pinedo et al.","Anaplasia; Anticancer; Antioxidant; Carcinogenic; Gastroenterology","antineoplastic agent; malonaldehyde; methylnitrosourea; nitric oxide; Oenothera rosea extract; plant extract; sodium chloride; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; anaplastic carcinoma cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antioxidant activity; Article; biochemical analysis; blood sampling; cancer prevention; controlled study; drug dose comparison; hematological parameters; histopathology; in vivo study; male; nonhuman; Oenothera; Oenothera rosea; rat; stomach cancer","","O.

Local populations have benefited from the uses of its richness of fauna and flora, promoting the emergence of a wide variety of uses. The Abujao river basin, located in the Peruvian Amazon, is home for mestizos and indigenous groups of Ashéninka and Shipibo-Conibo, whose traditions, and ancestral and ecological knowledge are still alive and closely related to their natural environments. This research was carried out to determine how and to what extent present groups of indigenous and mestizo in the Abujao river basin have been using the wild species of mammals and birds in their locations. Categories of its uses were determined. Among of all defined categories, the most predominant one was the use of wild animals for human consumption, traditional medicine and commercial trades. In contrast, relatively few species, in whole or part, were still used for rituals, and ornamental due to the loss of some ancestral knowledge and traditions on these uses. Revaluing this set of knowledge and uses has a great importance in the conservation of birds and mammals as well as the ecological knowledge of local populations in the Peruvian Amazon.","Abujao; Amazon; Ashéninka; Ethnozoology; Mestizo; Shipibo-Conibo; Use categories; Wet tropical forests; Wild birds; Wild mammals","","","","","Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Fac.

To understand the social representations of the Awajún and Wampis communities related to the symptoms and treatment of anemia in children younger than 3 years, as well as the relationship of these representations with the symbolism, constructs, and type of diet of these populations. Materials and methods. This qualitative study was conducted from June to August 2015 in the districts of Río Santiago, Cenepa, and Nieva (Amazon region, Peru), and included in-depth interviews (IDIs) of health personnel, community authorities, parents, and focus groups (FGs) for mothers. Results. A total of 38 IDIs and 13 FGs were conducted. The evaluated populations had limited awareness about anemia and health personnel, but anemia with symptoms were correlated with social representations and cultural manifestations. This behavior was reflected in the parents’ choice of treatments that were not necessarily the same as those indicated by the health personnel, and these social groups preferred the consumption of certain foods that were considered to cure the “putsumat”. Visiting a health care center or using micronutrients was not their first treatment option. Conclusions. Social representations and traditional practices still exist, and include interpretative systems in health, disease, and disease management. The logic, meaning, and coherence of these practices depend on the cultural group considered. The “putsumat” or “putsuju” is an interpretive model for anemia, and the symptoms in children include pallor, thinness, and fatigue; this model is based on the cultural system of the Awajún and Wampis populations © 2017, Instituto Nacional de Salud.

In the context of kidney diseases, the challenges and opportunities presented by traditional medicine practices are among the most important considerations for developing effective and sustainable public health strategies. However, little is known about the practices of traditional medicines in relation to kidney diseases, especially concerning benefits and harms. Kidney diseases may be caused, treated, prevented, improved, or worsened by traditional medicines depending on the setting, the person, and the types, modes, and frequencies of traditional medicine use. Given the profound knowledge gaps, nephrology practitioners and researchers may be uniquely positioned to facilitate more optimal public health strategies through recognition and careful investigation of traditional medicine practices. Effective implementation of such strategies also will require local partnerships, including engaging practitioners and users of traditional medicines. As such, practitioners and researchers investigating kidney diseases may be uniquely positioned to bridge the cultural, social, historical, and biologic differences between biomedicine and traditional medicine, and they have opportunities to lead efforts in developing public health strategies that are sensitive to these differences. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Ayurveda; kidney disease; low- and middle-income countries; traditional Chinese medicine; Traditional medicines","Aconitum extract; Aloe vera extract; Aristolochia fangchi extract; Arrabidaea brachypoda extract; Astragalus extract; Boerhaavia diffusa extract; Callilepsis laureola extract; Cecropia obtusifolia extract; Cecropia pachystachya extract; Coleus aromaticus extract; Cordyceps sinensis extract; Crotalaria labumifoli extract; Cuculigo orchiodes extract; Cymbopogon citratus extract; Cynodon dactylon extract; Dolichos biflorus extract; Emblica officinalis extract; Euphorbia matabalensis extract; Hibiscus sabdariffa extract; plant extract; Rheum palpatum extract; Securidaca longepedunculata extract; Smallanthus sonchifolius extract; Tripterygium wilfordii extract; Uncaria tomentosa extract; unclassified drug; Vitex polygama extract; acupuncture; acute kidney tubule necrosis; Africa south of the Sahara; arthralgia; arthritis; asthma; Ayurveda; biomedicine; bronchitis; Chinese medicine; chronic kidney failure; clinical examination; conjunctivitis; constipation; cultural factor; cystitis; dermatitis; diabetes mellitus; diabetic nephropathy; diarrhea; diet therapy; disease exacerbation; dysmenorrhea; dyspepsia; eczema; edema; electrolyte disturbance; epilepsy; fatigue; fever; flatulence; general practitioner; glomerulonephritis; glomerulopathy; health care access; hematuria; hemorrhoid; hepatorenal syndrome; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hyperkalemia; hypertension; hypotension; hypovolemia; immunoglobulin A nephropathy; impotence; India; infertility; inflammation; interstitial nephritis; ischemic heart disease; jaundice; kidney disease; kidney fibrosis; kidney ischemia; kidney tubule necrosis; libido disorder; liver cirrhosis; low income country; lupus vulgaris; malaria; malignant neoplasm; medical research; menorrhagia; middle income country; myalgia; nephritis; nephrolithiasis; nephrotic syndrome; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; oligomenorrhea; patient safety; polypharmacy; priority journal; psoriasis; public health service; qigong; Review; rheumatic heart disease; rheumatoid arthritis; risk benefit analysis; seizure; sexually transmitted disease; shock; skin disease; skin injury; snakebite; social aspect; South and Central America; thrush; traditional medicine; transitional cell carcinoma; urinary tract disease; urinary tract infection; developing country; economics; global health; health service; nephrology; procedures; utilization; Developing Countries; Global Health; Health Services; Humans; Medicine, Traditional; Nephrology; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic","","J.W.

In this research, direct contact of SPME probes with the interstitial fluid of plants was investigated as a method for phytochemical analysis. Objective Medicinal plants from the Amazon have been the source of numerous drugs used in western medicine. However, a large number of species used in traditional medicine have not been characterized chemically, partly due to the difficulty of field work. In this project, the phytochemical composition of plants from several genera was fingerprinted by combining convenient field sampling by solid phase microextraction (SPME) with laboratory analysis by LC-MS. The new method was compared with classical sampling followed by liquid extraction (LE). Methodology SPME probes were prepared by coating stainless steel wires with a mixture of polyacrylonitrile and either RP-amide or HS-F5 silica particles. Sampling was performed by inserting the microextraction probes into various tissues of living plants in their natural environment. After in vivo extraction, the probes were sealed under vacuum and refrigerated until analyzed. The probes were desorbed in mobile phase and analyzed on a Waters Acquity UPLC with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in positive ion mode. Results Twenty Amazonian plant species were sampled and unique metabolomic fingerprints were obtained. In addition, quantitative analysis was performed for previously identified compounds in three species. Comparison of the fingerprints obtained by in vivo SPME with those obtained by LE showed that 27% of the chromatographic features were unique to SPME, 57% were unique to LE, and 16% were common to both methods. Conclusion In vivo SPME caused minimal damage to the plants, was much faster than traditional liquid extraction, and provided unique fingerprints for all investigated plants. SPME revealed unique chromatographic features, undetected by traditional extraction, although it produced only half as many peaks as ethanol extraction. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Amazonian plants; LC-MS; Phytochemical fingerprinting; Quantitative analysis; Solid phase microextraction","Chemical analysis; Chromatography; Medical applications; Plants (botany); Positive ions; Probes; Stainless steel; Volatile organic compounds; Amazonian plants; LC-MS; Natural environments; Phytochemical; Phytochemical composition; Solid-phase microextraction; Stainless steel wires; Triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer; Extraction; alcohol; plant extract; polyacrylonitrile; Psychotria alba extract; Psychotria carthagenensis extract; Psychotria cincta extract; Psychotria officinalis extract; Psychotria remota extract; Psychotria stenostachya extract; silicon dioxide; Solanum wrightii extract; Tabernaemontana heterophylla extract; Tabernaemontana macrocalyx extract; Tabernaemontana markgrafiana extract; Tabernaemontana maxima extract; Tabernaemontana sananho extract; Tabernaemontana siphilitica extract; Uncaria guianensis extract; Uncaria tomentosa extract; unclassified drug; phytochemical; Article; controlled study; drug screening; field microextraction; in vivo study; intermethod comparison; liquid liquid extraction; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; minimally invasive procedure; nonhuman; plant tissue; priority journal; Psychotria; Psychotria alba; Psychotria carthagenensis; Psychotria cincta; Psychotria officinalis; Psychotria remota; Psychotria stenostachya; quantitative analysis; sampling; Solanum; Solanum wrightii; solid phase microextraction; Tabernaemontana; Tabernaemontana heterophylla; Tabernaemontana macrocalyx; Tabernaemontana markgrafiana; Tabernaemontana maxima; Tabernaemontana sananho; Tabernaemontana siphilitica; ultra performance liquid chromatography; Uncaria; Uncaria guianensis; Uncaria tomentosa; chemistry; medicinal plant; Peru; Phytochemicals; Plants, Medicinal; Solid Phase Microextraction","Funding for this research was provided in part by CIPNA-UNAS , Tingo María, Peru.

The aim of this research was to provide results on some health effects of oral administration of spray-dried extracts of black or red maca (Lepidium meyenii) in adult human subjects living at low (LA) and high altitude (HA). A total of 175 participants were given 3 g of either placebo, black, or red maca extract daily for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were changes in sexual desire, mood, energy, health-related quality of life score (HRQL), and chronic mountain sickness (CMS) score, or in glycaemia, blood pressure, and hemoglobin levels. Secondary outcomes were acceptability and safety, assessed using the Likert test and side effect self-recording, respectively, and the effect of altitude. At low altitude, 32, 30, and 32 participants started the study receiving placebo, red maca, or black maca, respectively. At high altitudes, 33, 35, and 31 participants started the study receiving placebo, red maca, and black maca, respectively. Consumption of spray-dried extracts of red and black maca resulted in improvement in mood, energy, and health status, and reduced CMS score. Fatty acids and macamides were higher in spray-dried extracts of black maca than in red maca. GABA predominated in spray-dried extracts of red maca. Effects on mood, energy, and CMS score were better with red maca. Black maca and, in smaller proportions, red maca reduced hemoglobin levels only in highlanders with abnormally high hemoglobin levels; neither variety of maca reduced hemoglobin levels in lowlanders. Black maca reduced blood glucose levels. Both varieties produced similar responses in mood, and HRQL score. Maca extracts consumed at LA or HA had good acceptability and did not show serious adverse effects. In conclusion, maca extract consumption relative to the placebo improved quality of life parameters. Differences in the level of improvement between red and black maca are probably due to differences in the composition of these two plant varieties. Both maca extracts were well tolerated and safe. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Adverse effects; Black maca; Botanicals; High altitude; Human health; Lepidium meyenii; Nutraceuticals; Placebo; Red maca; Toxicity","4 aminobutyric acid; fatty acid derivative; glucose; hemoglobin; Lepidium meyenii extract; macamide derivative; placebo; plant medicinal product; unclassified drug; adult; aged; altitude; altitude disease; Article; blood pressure measurement; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug determination; drug efficacy; drug response; drug safety; drug tolerability; energy expenditure; glucose blood level; health status; hemoglobin determination; human; human experiment; mood change; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; sexual behavior; treatment outcome; unspecified side effect; varietas","","G.F.

In S. areira essential oil, monoterpene hydrocarbons were the most represented class of volatiles (58.7%), including α-phellandrene, limonene, camphene, β-phellandrene, α-pinene, p-cymene, and β-pinene as the major components. In M. spicata, oxygenated monoterpenes (87.4%) were the major class of volatiles; among them pulegone, isomenthone, and menthone were the main compounds. Antioxidant activity were examined using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl assay. Essential oil from S. areira was also evaluated for its anti-proliferative activities against murine breast cancer cells (4T1).

Describe the diversity of traditional healers, their links with the formal health system and changes in their therapeutic resources in two rural Andean communities in Churcampa, in the region of Huancavelica, Peru. Materials and methods. Qualitative study which combined three ethnographic techniques: in depth interviews, observations and accompaniments to traditional healers and health care personnel. Results. 58 traditional healers, classified as healers, midwives and bonesetters were identified. Most healers interviewed learned their work while young and few had a teacher or mentor. The vast majority have objections to linking with health care facilities beyond referrals. There was no coordinated work among health personnel and traditional healers. However, when it happened, health personnel preferred those healers who have the willingness to adapt to the needs of the health services. We found that most of the healers were changing their practices due to the influence of evangelical churches. No healer had disciples to transmit their knowledge and practices. Conclusions. There is great diversity of traditional healers. This diversity is decreasing, among other factors, by the advance of the evangelical churches. Traditional healers refer some patients to the health facility; while health personnel establish hierarchical working relationships with the healers. It is necessary to work on these attitudes of the health care personnel, since the basis of an intercultural approach is to have coordinated and horizontal working relationships between both systems. © 2015, Instituto Nacional de Salud.

Cronquist is distributed in the Caribbean, Mesoamerica and Latin America. Preparations of the plant are traditionally used in Latin America for the treatment of various diseases including fever, malaria, and spleen or liver inflammations. Materials and methods Aerial parts of P. spiralis were extracted with either ethanol or distilled water. Seven hirsutinolide-type sesquiterpenoids were isolated: 8-acetyl-13-ethoxypiptocarphol (1), diacetylpiptocarphol (2), piptocarphins A (3), F (4) and D (5), (1S∗,4R∗,8S∗,10R∗)-1,4-epoxy-13-ethoxy-1,8,10-trihydroxygermacra-5E,7(11)-dien-6,12-olide (6), and piptocarphol (7). Extracts and isolated compounds (2, 3, 5-7) were screened for their in vitro antiplasmodial activity against the chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain FcM29-Cameroon and antileishmanial activity against three stages of Leishmania infantum. Their cytotoxicities were also evaluated against healthy VERO cell lines and J774A.1 macrophages, the host cells of the Leishmania parasites in humans. Results Aqueous extracts showed a greater inhibitory effect than alcoholic extracts, with IC<inf>50</inf> on P. falciparum of 3.0 μg/mL versus 21.1 μg/mL, and on L. infantum of 13.4 μg/mL versus >50 μg/mL. Both extracts were found to be cytotoxic to VERO cells (CC<inf>50</inf><3 μg/mL). Sesquiterpene lactones 2 and 3 showed the best activity against both parasites but failed in selectivity. Carbon 8 hydroxylated hirsutinolides 5-7 presented the particularity of exhibiting two conformers observed in solution during extensive NMR analyses in CD<inf>3</inf>OD and UHPLC-MS. The presence of a hydroxyl function at C-8 decreased the activity of 5-7 on the two parasites and also on VERO cells. Conclusion The antiplasmodial activity displayed by the aqueous extract explains the traditional use of P. spiralis in the treatment of malaria. This activity seems to be attributable to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones 2 and 3, the most active against P. falciparum. Aqueous extract and compounds 2, 3 and 6 were also active against L. infantum but lacked in selectivity due to their cytotoxicity towards macrophages. Exploring the safety and antiplasmodial efficacy of this traditional remedy will require further toxicological and in vivo studies in the light of the cytotoxicity towards healthy cell lines displayed by the aqueous extract and compounds 2 and 3. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Hirsutinolides; Leishmaniasis; Malaria; Pseudelephantopus spiralis; Sesquiterpene lactones","1,4 epoxy 13 ethoxy 1,8,10 trihydroxygermacra 5e,7 (11)dien 6,12 olide; 8 acetyl 13 ethoxypiptocarphol; alcohol; amphotericin B; antileishmanial agent; antimalarial agent; artemisinin; chloroquine; diacetylpiptocarphol; doxorubicin; hydroxyl group; miltefosine; pentamidine; piptocarphin a; piptocarphin d; piptocarphin f; piptocarphol; sesquiterpene lactone; sesquiterpenoid; unclassified drug; antiprotozoal agent; plant extract; sesquiterpene; amastigote; animal cell; antimalarial activity; Article; Asteraceae; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug identification; drug isolation; drug screening; host cell; IC50; in vitro study; Leishmania infantum; macrophage; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; Plasmodium falciparum; promastigote; Pseudelephantopus spiralis; ultra performance liquid chromatography; Vero cell line; animal; cell line; chemistry; Chlorocebus aethiops; drug effects; isolation and purification; metabolism; mouse; plant structures; traditional medicine; Pseudelephantopus; Animals; Antimalarials; Antiprotozoal Agents; Cell Line; Cercopithecus aethiops; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Macrophages; Medicine, Traditional; Mice; Plant Components, Aerial; Plant Extracts; Sesquiterpenes; Vero Cells","This work was performed in the framework of a collaborative and hosting agreement signed between CNRS, IRD and UPS-Toulouse.

We performed a descriptive study of health, health knowledge and practice, and healthcare access of 13 remote communities of the Manatí and Amazon Rivers in northeastern Peru. Eighty-five adults attending a medical boat service were interviewed to collect data on socioeconomic position, health, diagnosed illnesses, pain, healthcare access, and traditional versus modern medicine use. In this setting, poverty and gender inequality were prevalent, and healthcare access was limited by long distances to the health post and long waiting times. There was a high burden of reported pain (mainly head and musculoskeletal) and chronic non-communicable diseases, such as hypertension (19%). Nearly all participants felt that they did not completely understand their diagnosed illnesses and wanted to know more. Participants preferred modern over traditional medicine, predominantly because of mistrust or lack of belief in traditional medicine. Our findings provide novel evidence concerning transitional health beliefs, hidden pain, and chronic non-communicable disease prevalence in marginalized communities of the Peruvian Amazon. Healthcare provision was limited by a breach between health education, knowledge, and access. Additional participatory research with similar rural populations is required to inform regional healthcare policy and decision-making. © © 2015 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.","","adult; aged; Article; attitude to health; descriptive research; female; headache; health belief; health care access; health education; health service; human; hypertension; male; musculoskeletal pain; Peruvian; systematic review; traditional medicine; adolescent; chronic disease; cultural anthropology; demography; health care delivery; health services research; middle aged; Peru; poverty; prevalence; rural population; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Chronic Disease; Culture; Female; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services Research; Humans; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Poverty; Prevalence; Residence Characteristics; Rural Population; Young Adult","","T.

The Chaco is an edible medicinal clay that is used as slurry with water to restrain dyspeptic discomfort or acid-peptic manifestations. In this contribution we present physicochemical aspects of the composition of the Chaco, experimental animal studies that evaluate its antiulcer effect and in vitro test that studies the antacid property. The proposed mechanism of therapeutic action is due to a cytoprotective effect on the gastric mucosa by independent mechanisms of acid secretion inhibition, as it has no antacid property in vitro. Also it has an adsorptivity to different organic molecules due to their large surface area and tetrahedral charge that makes it to interact with polar substances such as water and toxins. The other purpose of this special contribution is to recognize the coexistence of ""Traditional Medicine"" and ""Western Medicine"", a situation which leads to the need for preclinical research of various natural resources.","","aluminum silicate; clay; protective agent; soil; animal; chemistry; drug effects; human; peptic ulcer; Peru; procedures; rat; stomach mucosa; traditional medicine; Aluminum Silicates; Animals; Gastric Mucosa; Humans; Medicine, Traditional; Peptic Ulcer; Protective Agents; Rats; Soil","","","","","10225129; 1609722X","","","25875525","Spanish","Rev Gastroenterol Peru","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016650530"

Poepp. and Endi. traditionally used in the Yanesha pharmacopoeia to treat skin infections such as leishmaniasis ulcers, or to reduce fever were chemically investigated to identify leishmanicidal compounds, as well as PPAR1 activators.Methods: Compounds were isolated through a bioassay-guided fractionation and their structures were determined via detailed spectral analysis. The viability of Leishmania amazonensis axenic amastigotes was assessed by the reduction of tetrazolium salt (MU), the cytotoxicity on macrophage was evaluated using trypan blue dye exclusion method, while the percentage of infected macrophages was determined microscopically in the intracellular macrophage-infected assay. The CD36, mannose receptor (MR) and dectin-1 mRNA expression on human monocytes-derived macrophages was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR.Results: Six sesquiterpenes (16), one dihydrobenzofuranone (7) and four fnlavonoids (811) were isolated from the leaves. Alongside, two ulavonoids (1213) and five diarylheptanoids (1418) were identified in the rhizomes. Leishmanicidal activity against Leishmania amazonensis axenic amastigotes was evaluated for all compounds. Compounds 6, 7, and 11, isolated from the leaves, showed to be the most active derivatives. Diarylheptanoids 1418 were also screened for their ability to activate PPAR1 nuclear receptor in macwphages. compounds 17 and 18 bearing a Michael acceptor moiety strongly increased the expression of PPAR1 target genes such as CD36, Dectin-1 and mannose receptor (MR), thus revealing interesting immunomodulatory properties.Conclusions: Phytochemical investigation of Renealmia thyrsoidea has led to the isolation of leishmanicidal compounds from the leaves and potent PPAR1 activators from the rhizomes.

The aim of the study was to assess the topic anti-inflammatory effect of the oils/fats as well as to evaluate its antimicrobial activity and fatty acid composition. Materials and methods The oils/fats were purchased from a traditional store at the Iquitos market of Belen, Peru. The topic anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by the mice ear edema induced by arachidonic acid (AA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) at the dose of 3 mg oil/ear. Indomethacine and nimesulide were used as reference anti-inflammatory drugs. The application resembles the traditional topical use of the oils. The antimicrobial effect of the oils/fats was assessed by the microdilution test against reference strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enteritidis. The fatty acid composition of the oils/fats (as methyl esters) was determined by GC and GC-MS analysis after saponification. Results All oils/fats showed topic anti-inflammatory activity, with better effect in the TPA-induced mice ear edema assay. The most active drugs were Potamotrygon motoro, Melanosuchus niger and Geochelone denticulata. In the AA-induced assay, the best activity was found for Potamotrygon motoro and Electrophorus electricus oil. The oil of Electrophorus electricus also showed a weak antimicrobial effect with MIC values of 250 μg/mL against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Salmonella enteritidis-MI. The main fatty acids in the oils were oleic, palmitic and linoleic acids. Conclusions Topical application of all the oils/fats investigated showed anti-inflammatory activity in the mice ear edema assay. The effect can be related with the identity and composition of the fatty acids in the samples. This study gives support to the traditional use of animal oils/fats as ant-inflammatory agents in the Peruvian Amazon. However, new alternative should be encouraged due to the conservation status of several of the animal sources of the crude drugs. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Amazonian Peru; Animal oils; Ethnozoology; Geochelone denticulate; Melanosuchus niger; Potamotrygon motoro","11 eicosenoic acid; arachidic acid; arachidonic acid; behenic acid; decanoic acid; elaidic acid; erucic acid; fatty acid; heptadecanoic acid; indometacin; lauric acid; linoleic acid; linolenic acid; myristic acid; nimesulide; octanoic acid; oil; oleic acid; palmitic acid; palmitoleic acid; pentadecanoic acid; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; stearic acid; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; antiinflammatory agent; fat; topical antiinfective agent; animal experiment; animal model; antibacterial activity; antiinflammatory activity; Article; Boa constrictor; caiman; controlled study; dilution; dolphin; ear edema; Electrophorus; Escherichia coli; evaluation study; fatty acid analysis; fish; gas chromatography; Geochelone denticulata; Inia geoffrensis; lipid composition; male; mass spectrometry; Melanosuchus niger; minimum inhibitory concentration; mouse; nonhuman; Peruvian; Potamotrygon motoro; Salmonella enteritidis; saponification; snake; Staphylococcus aureus; topical drug administration; tortoise; animal; chemistry; ethnopharmacology; mass fragmentography; Peru; plant disease; procedures; reptile; traditional medicine; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Infective Agents, Local; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Dolphins; Ethnopharmacology; Fats; Fatty Acids; Fishes; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Mice; Oils; Plant Pathology; Reptiles","We are grateful to FONDECYT, Chile , Grant no. 1130155 , CICITCA-UNSJ and Universidad Científica del Perú for financial support.

Following that lead, a botanical survey was conducted in Peru, where 47 species of Piperaceae were collected including 21 plants traditionally used for folk illnesses by the Yanesha of Peru, an indigenous Amazonian group. Materials and methods Two high throughput bioassays were used to quantify the in vitro activity of botanical extracts on the GABA system. Results Plant extracts demonstrated moderate to high affinity to the γ-aminobutyric acid benzodiazepine (GABA-BZD) receptor. In addition, extracts demonstrated low to moderate activity in the inhibition of the GABA-transaminase, with select plants exhibiting significant activity. Plants indicated by the Yanesha showed comparable activity to the other Piperaceae plants collected. Piper cremii was the most active plant in the GABA-BZD receptor assay, and Drymaria cordata (Caryophyllaceae) in the GABA-T assay. Conclusion The study provides evidence that there is a pharmacological basis behind the use of plants in the treatment of susto and mal aire in both Central and South America, and we propose that the possible mechanism of action includes an interaction with the GABA-T enzyme and/or the GABA<inf>A</inf>-BZD receptor. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Anxiety; Epilepsy; GABA-BZD receptor binding; GABA-Transaminase; Piperaceae","4 aminobutyrate aminotransferase; 4 aminobutyric acid; anticonvulsive agent; anxiolytic agent; benzodiazepine; Drymaria cordata extract; Elaphoglossum extract; Hedyosmum extract; Lantana camara extract; Mimosa pudica extract; Peperomia pertomentella extract; Piper acutifolium extract; Piper adreptum extract; Piper aduncum extract; Piper cremii extract; Piper denisii extract; Piper euriphyllum extract; Piper longifolium extract; Piper peltatum extract; Piper quimirianum extract; Piper subflavispicum extract; plant extract; unclassified drug; 4 aminobutyric acid A receptor; animal tissue; antiepileptic activity; Article; controlled study; drug activity; drug mechanism; drug receptor binding; drug screening; Drymaria cordata; EC50; Elaphoglossum; enzyme inhibition; GABAergic system; Hedyosmum; high throughput screening; IC50; in vitro study; nonhuman; Peperomia pertomentella; Peru; Piper acutifolium; Piper adreptum; Piper carpunya; Piper cremii; Piper denisii; Piper euriphyllum; Piper longifolium; Piper peltatum; Piper quimirianum; Piper subflavispicum; Piperaceae; rat; receptor binding assay; tranquilizing activity; antagonists and inhibitors; bioassay; metabolism; traditional medicine; 4-Aminobutyrate Transaminase; Biological Assay; Medicine, Traditional; Plant Extracts; Receptors, GABA-A","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Discovery Grant, G30360)) to JTA and Canadian Institutes of Health Research MOP 62826 to SALB and JTA.","","","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","03788741; 18727573","","JOETD","25091465","English","J.

Materials and methods A sound ethnopharmacological survey was performed during the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 in different places along Callejón de Huaylas valley in the peruvian Andes, were Quechua speaking communities dwell. Two different methodologies were used: first, plant uses were recorded during walks with informants and in medicinal plant markets held on a regular bases in the area (Huaraz, Carhuaz, Yungay). Secondly, traditional healers (curanderas, curanderos) were interviewed about their practices and healing sessions were observed, in order to understand better the traditional medicinal system as a whole (disease aetiology, diagnosis, treatments, healers). Results Altogether, 178 medicinal species were collected. Most of the plants found on the market were also found in the wild and vice-versa. Medicinal plant trade is exclusively held by women, selling their merchandise to local people or to big retailer. Plants are classified according their hot or cold virtues, this in accordance with the local conception of the body physiology and disease aetiology, based on a hot-cold polarity. Main use notified for medicinal plants is ""(bath) against cold"", a prophylactic measure against diseases of cold nature. Other uses include culture bound illnesses i.e. Susto, aire, nervios, or heart pain, commonly cited in South America. Regarding symptoms, rheumatic/arthritic pain, musculoskeletal traumas, cough, pulmonary and respiratory problems, gastritis and stomach ache, were the most frequently cited. Diagnosis and treatment are intrinsically linked together and mainly based upon divination techniques using egg and cuy (Cavia porcellus L.;Caviidae). Discussion and conclusion Medicinal plants use and traditional medicinal practices are still very vivid in Callejón de Huaylas as highlighted by the abundance of medicinal plants traded in the markets. In this business, women have a key position as healers at the family and community level. Medicinal uses of the majority of the species presented here are reported for the first time. Because medicinal plants sold on the market are collected from the wild and also because high altitude medicinal plants are generally small herbaceous species pulled out with their roots, there is a serious risk of over exploitation and extinction of endemic species.© 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Andes; Hot and cold system; Medicinal plants; Peru; Quechua; Traditional medicine","herbaceous agent; plant medicinal product; Acanthaceae; Adoxaceae; Alstroemeriaceae; Amaranthaceae; Anacardiaceae; anuria; Apiaceae; Apocynaceae; arthritis; article; Asparagaceae; Asteraceae; backache; Betulaceae; blurred vision; bone pain; Boraginaceae; Brassicaceae; Bromeliaceae; bronchitis; Cactaceae; cerebrovascular accident; common cold; contraception; coughing; Crassulaceae; depression; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; digestive system inflammation; Dryopteridaceae; Elaeocarpaceae; Ericaceae; ethnopharmacology; Euphorbiaceae; Fabaceae; fatigue; food poisoning; furunculosis; gastritis; Gentianaceae; Geraniaceae; Grossulariaceae; gynecologic infection; headache; heat stroke; hepatitis; human; infection; influenza; insect bite; insomnia; intestinal spasm; Juglandaceae; kidney pain; Krameriaceae; Lamiaceae; liver pain; Loganiaceae; Loranthaceae; lung disease; Malvaceae; medicinal plant; Melastomataceae; menstruation disorder; migraine; Myrtaceae; nausea; nephritis; nephrolithiasis; nonhuman; Onagraceae; Orchidaceae; otalgia; Oxalidaceae; paralysis; Peru; Piperaceae; Poaceae; Polygalaceae; Polygonaceae; Polypodiaceae; Primulaceae; prostate disease; Quechua (people); Ranunculaceae; respiratory tract disease; Rosaceae; Rubiaceae; Salicaceae; Sapindaceae; Scrophulariaceae; skin abscess; skin disease; Solanaceae; sprain; stiff neck; stomach pain; stomach spasm; stomach ulcer; tooth abscess; tooth pain; traditional healer; traditional medicine; Urticaceae; vagina discharge; verruca vulgaris; animal; chemistry; ethnic group; female; information processing; male; phytotherapy; procedures; Cavia porcellus; Caviidae; Animals; Data Collection; Ethnic Groups; Ethnopharmacology; Female; Humans; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Phytotherapy; Plant Preparations; Plants, Medicinal","","G.

The aim of this study is evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of M. macrocarpa in daily doses for 7 days on reproductive parameters of male mice. We used C57BL mature male mice divided into 2 groups (n= 10), Control Group (C): 0.9% NaCl and Treatment group (T): Aqueous extract of Chuchuhuasi, both supplied daily via oral gavages. At the eight day of treatment the mice were euthanized. The weight of the body and reproductive organs: testis, epididymis and vas deferens, were registered. Concentration, motility and sperm morphology were evaluated. The results showed significantly differences (t- Student test P<0.05) in the weight of the head and body epididymis (C: 19.25±1.1 vs T: 21.26±2.0), vas deferens (C: 10.61±0.7 vs T: 11.75±0.5), progressive sperm motility (C: 42.16±5.2 vs T: 25.82±8.4) and immobile sperm (C: 36.05±4.9 vs T: 48.51±7.2). No difference in sperm count was observed. The sperm normal morphology diminished with ingest of M. macrocarpa (t-Student test p <0.05) (C: 39.72±1.3 vs T: 30.78±4.9). We conclude that the aqueous extract of chuchuhuasi, has a negative effect on the male reproductive system of mice. © Los autores.","Chuchuhuasi; Infertility; Maytenus macrocarpa; Mouse; Sperm quality","","","L.G.

This paper details the uses of medicinal plants within this community, as recorded in two villages of the Paranapura basin, Soledad and Atahualpa de Conchiyacu. This study aimed to describe the basis of the Chayahuita traditional medical system, to document part of the medicinal plant corpus, and to compare it with data from other Amazonian ethnic groups. Material and methods: Methodology was based (i) on field prospection with 26 informants (ethnobotanical walks methodology), (ii) semi-structured interviews including 93 people (49 men and 44 women) focused on the most recent health problem experienced and on the therapeutic options chosen, (iii) individual or group thematic discussions relating to disease and treatments, (iv) 6-months of participants' observations between May 2007 and May 2008. At the end of the project in May 2008 a workshop was organized to cross-check the data with the help of 12 of the most interested informants. Results: Six hundred and seventeen voucher specimens were collected, corresponding to 303 different species, from which 274 (belonging to 83 families) are documented here. Altogether 492 recipes were recorded, corresponding to a global figure of 541 therapeutic uses and a total of 664 use reports. The main therapeutic uses are related to dermatological problems (103 uses; 19%), gastro-intestinal complaints (69 uses; 13%) and malaria/fevers (52 uses; 10%). Diseases are analysed according to Chayahuita concepts, and for each disease the species having a high frequency of citation are listed, and the most frequently used remedies are described. Whenever possible, comparisons with other Amazonian groups have been drawn. Conclusion: Chayahuita nosology and medical ethnobotany appear to draw their inspiration from a common panamazonian root. Despite the fact that a certain number of medicinal plants are shared with other nearby groups, there seem to be specific uses for some species, thus highlighting the originality of the Chayahuita pharmacopoeia. Presently there is a certain disinterest in the most traditional area of the Chayahuita medical ways, and the role of the penutu (shaman) seems to be less highly-valued than in the past. Nonetheless, the use of medicinal plants in phytotherapeutic treatment is very much a living, shared knowledge. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Gender is not only a determinant of inequality, but it also provides explanations for the different factors that have an impact on men and women's health, their disease and their death. This article addresses the factors that are prioritized over the information and decisions concerning the exercise of sexuality and how to regulate reproduction. With regards to the beginning of sexual life, men seem to start earlier, in average, they have their first sexual relation at 16.8 years old. As to the use of contraceptive methods, currently 54.2% of men declare to use them. Out of these, 39.5% choose modern methods whereas 14.5% prefer traditional ones. In Peru, among the modern methods available are the barrier methods (the condom being the most used), the chemical methods or spermicides, and the surgical methods (vasectomy). Among the traditional ones are the ""rhythm"", based on abstinence during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle, and the coitus interruptus. The father's role is one of power. Gender relations are relations of power, and parenthood is part of these relations. The father is, above all, the provider of filiation. Marginalization of men in the reproductive process is evident. Their support to their partner is suboptimal, whether it is during pregnancy, during delivery or to prevent the death of the mother.","Clinical; Contraception; Contraception behavior (source: MeSH NLM); Reproductive health","spermicidal agent; article; attitude to health; coitus interruptus; condom; contraception; decision making; dominance behavior; empowerment; fertility; gender; health care availability; human; menstrual cycle; modern times; onset age; parenthood; paternal behavior; reproductive behavior; reproductive health; sexuality; traditional medicine; vasectomy; Contraception; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Men; Role; Sexual Partners","","D.

Methods: The study was performed through oral interviews to a number of native Bora-Bora and healers from Lima, who voluntarily agreed to participate. We collected information about knowledge and custom in the use of chuchuhuasi. Results: Although on a purely commercial context, the healers from Lima reported to use chuchuhuasi for the following purposes: to cure asthma, as analgesic, and for sexual problems; and also they used it for mystical, magical, and religious purposes during healing sessions. The Amazonian Bora-Bora indigenous use chuchuhuasi for medicinal purposes, particularly for severe pain, postpartum pain, to stop postpartum bleeding, and as antidiarrheal. Conclusions: There are differences in the use of chuchuhuasi between native Bora-Bora Amazonian population, and healers in Lima, Peru. © Cita Publicaciones.","Chuchuhuasi; Healers; Maytenus macrocarpa; Medical uses; Traditional medicine","herbaceous agent; article; asthma; attitude to health; diarrhea; ethnic group; human; interview; Maytenus; maytenus macrocarpa; pain; Peru; postpartum hemorrhage; postpartum pain; religion; sexual dysfunction","","A.

DC. (Rubiaceae) is widely used by populations living in South America to treat many ailments associated with inflammatory disorders. Mitraphylline was shown to be the major pentacyclic oxindolic alkaloid present in the bark chloroformic extract of this plant. Its activity against cytokines involved in inflammation process was tested in a murine model in vivo. Materials and methods: Mice received mitraphylline once a day for 3 days at 30 mg/kg/day by oral route. Then, they were subjected to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin (15 mg/kg) and the LPS-induced production of 16 different cytokines was determined by Elisa multiplex. Control group received dexamethasone orally at 2 mg/kg/day. Toxicity on K565 cells and murine peritoneal macrophages, in vitro, at doses up to 100 μM was monitored by XTT-colorimetric assay. Results and conclusions: For the first time mitraphylline was tested in vivo against a large range of cytokines that play a crucial role in inflammation. Mitraphylline inhibited around 50% of the release of interleukins 1α, 1β, 17, and TNF-α. This activity was similar to dexamethasone. It also reduced almost 40% of the production of interleukin 4 (IL-4) while the corticoid did not. Lastly it did not show any toxicity on K565 cells nor murine macrophages at doses up to 100 μM. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Plant species were selected based on interviews conducted with residents of rural areas. The different plant parts were dried, powdered, and extracted by maceration with different solvents (hexane, chloroform, and 70% ethanol-water). These extracts were tested on promastigote forms of Leishmania infantum strain PB75, epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi strain Y, and the mammalian CHO cell line. Parasite viability and nonspecific cytotoxicity were analyzed by a modified MTT colorimetric assay method. The isolation and identification of pure compounds from selected extracts were performed by column chromatography, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS; mixtures), spectroscopic techniques [MS, infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV)], and mono and two-dimensional 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR; COSY, HSQC, NOESY) experiments. Chondodendron tomentosum bark and Cedrela odorata were the most active extracts against Leishmania, while C. odorata and Aristoloquia pilosa were the most active against Trypanosoma, followed by Tabebuia serratifolia, Tradescantia zebrina, and Zamia ulei.

The burden of epilepsy in low-income countries is more than twice that found in high-income countries, probably because the incidence of risk factors is higher. Many of these risk factors can be prevented with inexpensive interventions, but there are only a few studies that have assessed the effect of reducing risk factors on the burden of epilepsy. The mortality associated with epilepsy in low-income countries is substantially higher than in less impoverished countries and most deaths seem to be related to untreated epilepsy (eg, as a result of falls or status epilepticus), but the risk factors for death have not been adequately examined. Epilepsy is associated with substantial stigma in low-income countries, which acts as a barrier to patients accessing biomedical treatment and becoming integrated within society. Seizures can be controlled by inexpensive antiepileptic drugs, but the supply and quality of these drugs can be erratic in poor areas. The treatment gap for epilepsy is high (>60%) in deprived areas, but this could be reduced with low-cost interventions. The substantial burden of epilepsy in poor regions of the world can be reduced by preventing the risk factors, reducing stigma, improving access to biomedical diagnosis and treatment, and ensuring that there is a continuous supply of good quality antiepileptic drugs.","","carbamazepine; phenobarbital; phenytoin; valproic acid; alternative medicine; article; bacterial infection; brain damage; cerebrovascular disease; cultural factor; developing country; disability; disease surveillance; drug cost; electroencephalography; encephalitis; epilepsy; Ethiopia; falling; focal epilepsy; head injury; health care access; health care cost; health care delivery; health care disparity; health education; health program; health service; incidence; infection prevention; Kenya; life expectancy; lowest income group; malaria falciparum; meningitis; mortality; mycosis; neurocysticercosis; neuroimaging; newborn hypoxia; onset age; parasitosis; poverty; premature labor; prenatal care; prevalence; primary prevention; priority journal; religion; risk factor; stigma; stroke; traditional medicine; traffic accident; violence","CRN (No. 083744) and HHG (091077) are funded by the Wellcome Trust, UK.

C.F. Baker, which has demonstrated strong biological activity towards Leishmania amazonensis. Our goal was to discover the active compound of this plant-based remedy. Materials and methods: A bioguided fractionation of the crude extract was undertaken based on the biological activity recorded against Leishmania amazonensis axenic amastigotes in in vitro bioassays. Results: Three strongly to moderately active compounds were isolated: two hirsutinolides (the 8,13-diacetyl-piptocarphol and the 8-acetyl-13-O-ethyl-piptocarphol) and ursolic acid. IC<inf>50</inf> against Leishmania amazonensis axenic amastigotes are respectively 0.2, 0.37 and 0.99 μM (while IC<inf>50</inf> of amphotericin B is 0.41 μM). These compounds have never been isolated from this plant species, and germacranolides have never been identified as potential antileishmanial agents. Conclusions: The compounds isolated from Pseudelephantopus spicatus account for the antileishmanial activity of the plant, thus giving support to its use by the Chayahuita in Peru. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved.","Asteraceae; Chayahuita; Hirsutinolides; Leishmaniasis; Peru; Pseudelephantopus spicatus; Traditional remedy","8,13 diacetylpiptocarphol; acetyl 13 o ethylpiptocarphol; amphotericin B; antileishmanial agent; plant extract; Pseudelephantopus spicatus extract; sesquiterpene lactone derivative; unclassified drug; ursolic acid; amastigote; article; biological activity; IC 50; in vitro study; Leishmania; leishmaniasis; medicinal plant; nonhuman; Peru; Pseudelephantopus spicatus; traditional medicine; Amphotericin B; Asteraceae; Chemical Fractionation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Indians, South American; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Lactones; Medicine, Traditional; Plant Components, Aerial; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Sesquiterpenes; Triterpenes; Trypanocidal Agents; Leishmania amazonensis","","G.

Most remedies are prepared as ethanol or aqueous extracts and then ingested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential toxicity of these extracts. Materials and methods: The toxicity of ethanolic and water extracts of 341 plant species was determined using a brine-shrimp assay. Results: Overall 24% of the species in water extract and 76% of the species in alcoholic extract showed elevated toxicity levels to brine-shrimp. Although in most cases multiple extracts of the same species showed very similar toxicity values, in some cases the toxicity of different extracts of the same species varied from non-toxic to highly toxic. Conclusions: Traditional preparation methods take different toxicity levels in aqueous and ethanol extracts into account when choosing the appropriate solvent for the preparation of a remedy. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved.","Artemia salina; Brine shrimp; Ethnobotany; Medicinal plants; Northern Peru; Toxicity","Acanthoxanthium spinosum extract; Achillea millefolium extract; achyrocline alata extract; Adiantum concinnum extract; Alternanthera porrigens extract; Alternanthera villosa extract; Ambrosia peruviana extract; Ammi visna extract; Annona muricata extract; apium graveolens extract; Aristolochia ruiziana extract; Arracacia xanthorrhiza extract; Baccharis glutinosa extract; Baccharis salicifolia extract; Coriandrum sativum extract; Eustephia coccinea extract; Foeniculum vulgare extract; Gomphrena globosa extract; Hydrocotyle globiflora extract; Ilex guayusa extract; Iresine herbstii extract; Mandevilla antennacea extract; Mandevilla trianae extract; Nerium oleander extract; Niphogeton dissecta extract; plant extract; Schinus molle extract; thevetia peruviana extract; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; Vallesa glabra extract; Acanthoxanthium spinosum; Achillea; Achyrocline alata; Adiantum concinnum; Alternanthera porrigens; Alternanthera villosa; Ambrosia peruviana; Ammi visna; angiosperm; annona muricata; Aristolochia ruiziana; Arracacia xanthorrhiza; Artemia; article; Asteraceae; Baccharis glutinosa; Baccharis salicifolia; Balanophoraceae; Berberidaceae; Betulaceae; Bignoniaceae; Bixaceae; Boraginaceae; Brassicaceae; Bromeliaceae; Burseraceae; Cactaceae; Calceolariaceae; Campanulaceae; Capparidaceae; Caprifoliaceae; Caryophyllaceae; celeriac; Chloranthaceae; Clethraceae; Commiphoraceae; Convolvulaceae; coriandrum sativum; Crassulaceae; cucumber; Cupressaceae; Cyperaceae; Dioscoreaceae; Dipsaceae; Ephedraceae; Equisetaceae; Ericaceae; Euphorbia; Eustephia coccinea; fennel; Gentianaceae; Geraniaceae; gomphrena globosa; goosefoot; Guttiferae; Hydrocotyle globiflora; Ilex guayusa; Iliciaceae; Iresine herbstii; Iridaceae; Juglandaceae; Krameriaceae; legume; Lobeliaceae; Loganiaceae; Lycopodiaceae; Lythraceae; Malpighiaceae; Mandevilla antennacea; Mandevilla trianae; Mauria heterophylla; Mauria heterophylla extract; medicinal plant; Melastomataceae; Menispermaceae; Monimiaceae; Moraceae; Myrtaceae; nerium oleander; Niphogeton dissecta; nonhuman; Olacaceae; Onagraceae; Orchidaceae; Paparvaceae; passion fruit; Peru; Phytolaccaceae; Piperaceae; Plantaginaceae; Poaceae; Polemoniaceae; Polypodiaceae; Proteaceae; Pteridaceae; Ranunculaceae; Rosaceae; Rubiaceae; Rutaceae; Salicaeae; Schinus molle; Scrophulariaceae; Smilacaceae; thevetia peruviana; traditional medicine; Ulmaceae; Urticaceae; Valerianaceae; Vallesa glabra; Verbenaceae; Violaceae; Viscaceae; Zingiberaceae; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Ethanol; Lethal Dose 50; Medicine, Traditional; Plants, Medicinal; Risk Assessment; Solvents; Toxicity Tests; Water; Artemia salina","Funding text 1: The presented study was financed through MHIRT ( Minority Health Disparity International Research and Training , Fund: 54112B MHIRT Program, Grant: G0000613 ), coordinated by San Diego State University (SDSU) in cooperation with the San Diego Museum of Man (SDMM), the P.A.

Often, these plants are locally called plantas con madre (plants with a mother), and are thought to guide initiates in the process of seeking sacred knowledge, learning about plant usage, and understanding traditional medicine practices. We illustrate the diversity of plants used in the apprenticeship and practice of traditional medicine, and nurture the discussion to better understand the terminology used by Indigenous healers to describe plant uses and their practices. Materials and methods: The study was conducted between 2003 and 2008 with the participation of 29 curanderos (healers; 23 men, 6 women), 3 apprentices and 4 herbalists. The participants belonged to four ethnic groups: 17 Mestizos, 15 Shipibo-Konibo, 1 Ashaninka, and 1 Matsiguenga; a Spanish apprentice and an Italian herbalist were also included in the study. The field data were collected using semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and the witnessing of numerous healing sessions. Oral informed consent was obtained from each participant. Results: We identified 55 plant species belonging to 26 botanical families, which are used in initiation processes and apprenticeships of traditional medicine. This group of plants is administered under strict conditions during training and healing sessions called dietas (shamanic diets), with the supervision of one or more maestros curanderos (master healers). We observed that during the shamanic diets, maestros curanderos administered plants depending on the teachings or tools he/she was passing on, and were based on a particular sequence during the initiation process: (I) purification and cleansing species; (II) sensitivity and intuition; (III) strengthening; and (IV) protection and defence. Conclusions: Traditional healers continue to be a primary source of health care for the majority of the population in the Amazon region. Our research suggests that the system of dietas and the plantas con madre are fundamental components of the everyday practice of traditional medicine, maintenance of cultural continuity and Indigenous cosmovisions in the Amazonian societies in East-Central Peru. This paper contributes to filling the gap in the understanding of the process of initiation among healers in this area of the world. The study offers evidence of the need to collaborate with Indigenous healers to improve the recognition of their medical practices, role in their societies, and the value of their tools and medicines. A respectful attitude and open exchange of ideas and information may contribute to a better understanding of the language used by traditional medical practitioners, their practice, and their worldviews. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Amazonia; Ethnobotany; Indigenous knowledge; Medicinal plants; Peru; Psychotropic plants; Shamanic diet; Traditional medicine","angiosperm; Annonaceae; Apocynaceae; Araceae; Aristolochia cauliflora; Aristolochiaceae; article; banisteriopsis caapi; Bignonaceae; Bixaceae; Brunfelsia grandiflora; Burseraceae; Celastraceae; cleaning; Cyperaceae; diet; Erythroxylaceae; ethnobotany; Euphorbia; Ficus insipida; Ficus schultesii; goosefoot; healing; indigenous knowledge; Iridaceae; knowledge; Lecythidaceae; legume; Loganiaceae; Malpighiaceae; medicinal plant; Meliaceae; Menispermaceae; Moraceae; Nicotiana rustica; nonhuman; Olacaceae; Peru; Phytolaccaceae; Psychotria viridis; Rubiaceae; Shamanic diet; teaching; traditional medicine; Ethnobotany; Female; Humans; Male; Plants, Medicinal; Shamanism","","M.

Efforts to investigate such remedies in terms of neuropharmacology have been limited. Aim of this study: This study identified Amazonian ethnomedicines with potential for the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and dementias, and characterized their interactions with CNS neurotransmitter receptors in vitro. Materials and methods: Approximately 300 Amazonian species with folk uses or constituents indicative of central nervous system activity were incorporated into a database constructed from literature searches, herbarium surveys, and interviews with traditional practitioners. Approximately 130 of these targeted species were collected in Loreto province, Peru, and 228 fractions derived from them were screened in 31 radioreceptor assays via the resources of the NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program. A subset was also screened in functional assays at selected serotonin, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptors. Results: Ninety-one samples displayed ≥60% inhibition of radioligand binding activity in receptor assays; 135 samples displayed agonist or antagonist activity (or both) in functional assays. Conclusions: Potential CNS activity was detected in about 40% of the samples screened, with some correlations to both folk uses and phytochemical constituents.

They have also been the source of lead compounds for modern medicine, but the extent of mining of natural compounds for such leads decreased during the second half of the 20th century. The advantage of natural compounds for the development of drugs derives from their innate affinity for biological receptors. Natural compounds have provided the best anti-malarials known to date. Recent surveys have identified many extracts of various organisms (mostly plants) as having antiplasmodial activity. Huge libraries of fractionated natural compounds have been screened with impressive hit rates. Importantly, many cases are known where the crude biological extract is more efficient pharmacologically than the most active purified compound from this extract. This could be due to synergism with other compounds present in the extract, that as such have no pharmacological activity. Indeed, such compounds are best screened by cell-based assay where all potential targets in the cell are probed and possible synergies identified. Traditional medicine uses crude extracts. These have often been shown to provide many concoctions that deal better with the overall disease condition than with the causative agent itself. Traditional medicines are used by ∼80 % of Africans as a first response to ailment. Many of the traditional medicines have demonstrable anti-plasmodial activities. It is suggested that rigorous evaluation of traditional medicines involving controlled clinical trials in parallel with agronomical development for more reproducible levels of active compounds could improve the availability of drugs at an acceptable cost and a source of income in malaria endemic countries. © 2011 Ginsburg and Deharo; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","antimalarial agent; artemetin; Artemisia annua extract; artemisinin; atovaquone; azithromycin; casticin; chlortetracycline; chrysoplenetin; chrysosplenol D; Cinchona alkaloid; cinchonidine; cinchonine; cirsilineol; clindamycin; doxycycline; drug metabolite; erythromycin; flavonoid; natural product; oxytetracycline; quinidine; tetracycline; unclassified drug; antibiotic resistance; antimalarial activity; Artemisia annua; biochemistry; biosynthesis; cell therapy; chemical modification; chemotherapy; combinatorial chemistry; drug absorption; drug design; drug distribution; drug excretion; drug industry; drug metabolism; drug potentiation; drug quality; drug research; drug targeting; high throughput screening; human; hydrolysis; malaria; medicinal plant; multidrug resistance; nonhuman; patient safety; regulatory mechanism; review; traditional medicine; Antimalarials; Biological Products; Drug Discovery; Humans; Malaria; Medicine, Traditional; Plants; Plasmodium","","H.

The World Health Organization has expressed high interest in Traditional Medicine (TM), and it is important to demonstrate scientifically that the remedies employed in folk medicine are indeed therapeutically active. In order to evaluate the antibacterial activity of species used in traditional medicine in Northern Peru, 525 plant samples of at least 405 species were tested in simple agar-bioassays for antibacterial activity under simple laboratory conditions in a private clinic in Trujillo, Peru. Antibacterial activity was investigated against Staphylococcus aureus Rosenbach 1884, Escherichia coli (Migula 1895) Castellani & Chalmers 1919, Salmonella enterica Typhi (ex Kauffmann & Edwards 1952) Le Minor & Popoff 1987, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Schröter 1872) Migula 1900. The aim of the study was to scientifically test whether plants used in TM for the treatment of infections showed antibacterial activity, and to delineate a number of candidates for further in-depth study of their Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and toxicity. One-hundred-ninety-three ethanolic extracts and 31 water extracts were active against S. aureus. In twentyone cases only the water extract showed activity. None of the aqueous extracts were active against the other three bacteria, with the activity of the ethanolic extracts also much reduced, as only 36 showed any activity against E. coli, and 3 each against S. enterica Typhi and P. aeruginosa. Two-hundred-twenty-five extracts came from species that are traditionally employed against bacterial infections. One-hundred-sixty-six (73.8%) of these were active against at least one bacterium. Of the three-hundred extracts from plants without traditional antibacterial use, only 96 (32%) showed any activity Plants used for respiratory disorders, inflammation/infection, wounds, diarrhea, and to prevent post partum infections were efficacious in 70- 88% of the tests. Plants used for ""kidney inflammation"" had a much lower efficacy against bacteria and fell within the range of species that are traditionally used to treat other bodily disorders.","","Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Salmonella enterica; Staphylococcus aureus","","R.

However, there are not many scientific reports about the properties of these plants and their side effects. In this study, the effect of the aqueous extract of Origanum vulgare on the preimplantational mouse embryo development was investigated. The oregano aqueous extract was given ad libitum to four separated groups (n= 10) of pregnant mice: O, 9, 18 y 36 mg/mL respectively. When the embryos were evaluated, a slight delay in the embryo development was observed, but only with the highest dose. With respect to embryo quality, an increase of degenerated embryos was observed but this was not significant. These results showed that the aqueous extract of O. vulgare does not have a toxic effect on preimplantational mouse embryo, and it only produces a slight delay in embryo development. © Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas UNMSM","Embryotoxicity; Origanum vulgare; Preimplantational embryo; Traditional Medicine","","","V.

Materials and methods: The antimicrobial activity of ethanolic and water extracts of 141 plant species was determined using a deep-well broth microdilution method on commercially available bacterial strains. Results: The ethanolic extracts of 51 species inhibited Escherichia coli, and 114 ethanolic extracts inhibited Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast, only 30 aqueous extracts showed activity against Escherichia coli and 38 extracts against Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC concentrations were mostly very high and ranged from 0.008 to 256. mg/ml, with only 36 species showing inhibitory concentrations of <4. mg/ml. The ethanolic extracts exhibited stronger activity and a much broader spectrum of action than the aqueous extracts. Hypericum laricifolium, Hura crepitans, Caesalpinia paipai, Cassia fistula, Hyptis sidifolia, Salvia sp., Banisteriopsis caapi, Miconia salicifolia and Polygonum hydropiperoides showed the lowest MIC values and would be interesting candidates for future research. Conclusions: The presence of antibacterial activity could be confirmed in most species used in traditional medicine in Peru which were assayed in this study. However, the MIC for the species employed showed a very large range, and were mostly very high. Nevertheless, traditional knowledge might provide some leads to elucidate potential candidates for future development of new antibiotic agents. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Antibacterial; Escherichia coli; Ethnobotany; Medicinal plants; Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC); South America; Staphylococcus aureus","achyrocline alata extract; Adiantum concinnum extract; Alternanthera porrigens extract; Annona muricata extract; antiinfective agent; apium graveolens extract; Baccharis vaccinioides extract; Banisteriopsis caapi extract; Bidens pilosa extract; Caesalpinia paipai extract; Cassia fistula extract; Diplostephium sagasteguii extract; Eustephia coccinea extract; Gomphrena globosa extract; Hura crepitans extract; Hypericum laricifolium extract; Hyptis sidifolia extract; Ilex guayusa extract; Iresine herbstii extract; Matricaria recutita extract; Miconia salicifolia extract; Munnozia lyrata extract; Nerium oleander extract; plant extract; Polygonum hydropiperoides extract; Porophyllum ruderale extract; Pseudogynoxys cordifolia extact; Schkuhria pinnata extact; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; Vallesia glabra extract; antibacterial activity; aqueous solution; article; bacterial strain; broth dilution; controlled study; Escherichia coli; medicinal plant; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; Peru; Staphylococcus aureus; traditional medicine; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Developing Countries; Medicine, Traditional; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Bacteria (microorganisms); Banisteriopsis caapi; Caesalpinia; Cassia fistula; Hura crepitans; Hypericum laricifolium; Hyptis; Miconia; Negibacteria; Polygonum hydropiperoides; Posibacteria; Salvia","","R.W.

Maca is traditionally used for its nutritional and presumed medici-nal properties. Over the past 20 years, interest in maca has increased in many parts of the world, and since 2005 maca is considered one of the seven Peruvian flag products. Maca is exported as powder, capsules, pills, flour, liquor, and extracts. There are different types of maca with differ-ent colors ranging from white to black. We have studied the pharmacological effects of 3 types; yellow, black, and red maca. Evidence from experimental studies indicates effects of maca on nutrition, fertility, memory, and mood. Black maca has better effects on sperm production than yellow maca which has only moderate effects. Red maca, however, has no effect on sperm production. However, red maca has been shown to reduce prostate size in rats in which prostate hyperplasia had been induced with testosterone enanthate; yellow maca has shown moderate effects here, whereas black maca has not shown any effects. Randomized clinical trials have shown that maca has favorable effects on energy and mood, may decrease anxiety and improve sexual desire. Maca has also been shown to improve sperm production, sperm motility, and semen volume. Serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH, and prolactin were not affected. The exact mechanisms of action are still unclear, but so far research clearly indicates that various bioactive constituents contribute to the clini-cal effects reported.","Clinical trials; Experimental studies; Lepidium meyenii; Maca","fertility promoting agent; plant extract; affect; animal; chemistry; clinical trial; drug effect; history; human; Lepidium; male; memory; nutritional value; Peru; review; spermatozoon; traditional medicine; Affect; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Fertility Agents, Male; History, 16th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 20th Century; History, Ancient; Humans; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Memory; Nutritive Value; Plant Extracts; Spermatozoa","","G.

Many plants are considered to improve dogs' sense of smell or stimulate them to hunt better, while others treat common illnesses that prevent dogs from hunting. This work places canine ethnoveterinary medicine within the larger context of Aguaruna ethnomedicine, by testing the following hypotheses: H1 -- Plants that the Aguaruna use to treat dogs will be the same plants that they use to treat people and H2 -- Plants that are used to treat both people and dogs will be used for the same illnesses in both cases. Methods: Structured interviews with nine key informants were carried out in 2007, in Aguaruna communities in the Peruvian department of Amazonas. Informants provided freelists of plants given to dogs and explained the purpose, preparation and route of administration used. For each plant, informants also described any uses for treating people. Botanical voucher specimens were collected and additional informal observations were made, accompanying people on hunting trips. Results: Out of 35 plant species given to dogs, 29 (83%) are also given to humans for some medicinal purpose, while five are used only for dogs. However, the same plant is used to treat the same illness in both humans and dogs in only 53% of the cases. Forty-three percent of plants used to treat a particular illness for both dogs and people are administered in the same manner for both. Conclusion: Results suggest that Aguaruna canine ethnoveterinary medicine is, at least partly, an independent cognitive domain. Some of the difference in plant use between dogs and people can be explained by the fact that certain diseases mentioned only apply to dogs. Although reports of canine ethnoveterinary medicine are very sparse in the literature, Aguaruna practices show some similarities with a few trends reported for other Amazonian societies, particularly, in the prevalence of the nasal route of administration, the use of plant-based psychoactives and in the importance of ants and wasps, in some form, for training dogs. © 2009 Jernigan; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Canis familiaris; Formicidae","","K.A.

This study documents traditional Chayahuita plant's use and disease concepts. Also, activty of some medicinal plants used by the Chayahuita is highlighted and discussed. Materials and methods: Ninety-three Chayahuita people were interviewed, following a semi-structured questionnaire focussed on disease knowledge and perception, personal attitude and healing practices. Simultaneously, a collection of plants was performed in different ecotopes, in order to make an extensive inventory of the pharmacopoeia. Results: For the Chayahuita, cutaneous (CL) and muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) are considered as diseases of their own, with specific names, aetiologies, mode of transmission. Regarding CL, Chayahuita people consider that the humid characteristic of the skin ulcer is a discriminative fact orienting the diagnostic forTa'ta' (leishmaniasis). Forty-six different species were designated useful against LC and /or MCL (29 species by means of the questionnaire and 27 species when collecting in different ecotopes). Thirty-seven extracts corresponding to 31 species used medicinally were screened in vitro against Leishmania amazonensis axenic amastigotes, assessing their viability by the reduction of tetrazolium salt (MTT). Six species displayed a good activity (10 μg/ml < IC50 < 20 μg/ml): an undetermined hemi-epiphytic Clusiaceae, Cybianthus anthuriophyllus Pipoly (Myrsinaceae), two Piper, Piper sanguineispicum Trel., and Piper loretoanum Trel. (Piperaceae), Desmodium axillare Sw. DC. (Fabaceae), and Clibadium sylvestre (Aubl.) Baill. (Asteraceae). Conclusion: Perception of leishmaniasis, attitude, treatments and diet prohibitions still largely reflects traditional Chayahuita cosmovision, even if some tentative of bio-medical re-interpretation is arising. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

These particular Quechuas, as well as the region of Chazuta, have been seldom studied from an academic point of view. With the objective of contributing to the ethnopharmacological knowledge of the area, a field survey on the use of medicinal plants was performed in the region. Material and methods: The information was obtained through interviews to the 6.3% of the district rural adult population (140 individuals, 75% of which was considered Quechua). Results: In total, the study recorded 945 medicinal use-reports of 289 plant species collected in Chazuta, which belong to 202 genera in 81 families of vascular plants. Mainly, plant remedies were employed to treat musculoskeletal disorders (29.7% of all the medicinal use-reports), gastrointestinal complaints (13.4%) and skin conditions (12.9%). Conclusions: In Chazuta, medicinal plants are used within a context of a traditional medicine that confronts health and illness from an integral vision, in which the medicinal uses of plants, its combination with lifestyle advice, and its participation in the performance of rituals and other practices concerning to what is often named as ""the world of spirits"" have to be considered. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

OBJECTIVES: to determine the diuretic activity of above mentioned extract in rats. METHODS: twenty Holtzman rats were used in this study divided into four groups (n= 5). Previous fasting of 18 hours, all rats were hydrated using 5 mL/100 g of saline solution. Group 1 received 5 mL/kg of this solution (negative control); group 2 received intraperitoneal Furosemide in dose of 10 mg/kg (positive control); the groups 3 and 4 received intraperitoneal methanol extract from P. edulis leaves in dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg, respectively. RESULTS: at 24 hours, urine collectable volumes in groups treated with methanol extract from P. edulis leaves were significantly different from that of control group, but not from that in Furosemide group. CONCLUSIONS: diuretic activity of methanol extract from maracuyá leaves was demonstrated.","Diuretics; Maracuyá; Passiflora edulis","Passiflora edulis; Rattus","","J.

Most of the selected species (19) are traditionally used by the Chayahuitas, an Amazonian Peruvian ethnic group, to treat skin affections and/or leishmaniasis. Material and Methods: A colorimetric method based on the reduction of tetrazolium salt (MTT) was used to measure the viability of Leishmania amazonensis promastigote and amastigote stages. Results and Conclusions: Only the leaves of two species of the Piperaceae family (Piper hispidum Sw., and Piper strigosum Trel.) showed good leishmanicidal activities (IC<inf>50</inf> < 10 μg/ml against amastigotes). Roots of Tabernaemontana sananho Ruiz & Pav. (Apocynaceae), together with bark of Vismia tomentosa Ruiz & Pav. (Clusiaceae), fruits of Solanum straminifolium var straminifolium Jacq. (Solanaceae), and stems of Zamia lindenii Regel ex André (Cycadaceae) showed low activity against amastigote stage (IC<inf>50</inf> around 50 μg/ml). Of those only Tabernaemontana sananho displayed also good activity on promastigotes (IC<inf>50</inf> < 10 μg/ml).

An ethnographic survey concerning the native theory of illness aetiology in the specific case of malaria permitted the elaboration of an efficient ethnopharmacological enquiry. The survey took place on three main zones corresponding to villages on the Napo and the Pastaza rivers (for the Quechua), and in the surroundings of Iquitos (for the Mestizos) and led to the collection of 14 plants. Serial extractions in hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol were performed on the different parts of the plants collected. The extracts were then tested for antiplasmodial activity in vitro. Seven plants displayed antiplasmodial activity (IC<inf>50</inf> from 2 to 25 μg/mL) and usually low cytotoxicity, indicating their antiplasmodial specificity.

The objective in this paper was to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of the methanolic extract (ME) of the black, purple and yellow ecotypes of Lepidium peruvianum, Chacón (at present Lepidium meyenii Walp.), Maca, on the cellular lines HeLa (Human Epithelial Carcinoma) and HT-29 (Human Colon Adenocarcinoma). For the cellular line HT-29, the inhibitory concentration of 50% of the cellular growth (IC50) with the black, purple and yellow ecotypes was of 8,32 mg/ml, 9,28 mg/ml and 0,487 mg/ml, respectively; while for the cellular line HeLa was of 2,4 mg/ml, 1,93 mg/ml and 0,66 mg/ml respectively. Additionally, ME of the yellow ecotype was evaluated with two years of storage (10°C) determining an IC50 4,29 mg/ml for HT-29 and 4,17 mg/ml for HeLa.

Methods: Basic quantitative and qualitative information was gathered as part of a community health project implemented between 1997 and 2002 in 40 Andean communities with information from questionnaires, personal interviews and group discussions. Results: The majority of current community health workers are men with limited education who are primarily Quechua speakers undertaking their work on a voluntary basis. Health promoters are mostly young, male, high school graduates. There exists a high drop-out rate among these workers. In contrast, traditional healers and traditional birth attendants possess an almost diametrically opposite profile in terms of age, education and drop-out rates, though males still predominate. At the community level the health promoters are the most visible community health workers. Conclusion: It is very important to consider and to be aware of the profile of community health workers in order to provide appropriate alternatives when working with these groups as well as with the indigenous population, particularly in terms of culture, language and gender issues. © 2006 Brown et al; licensee Biomed Central Ltd.","","adult; aged; article; community care; controlled study; cultural factor; education; female; health care personnel; health program; high school; human; indigenous people; interview; language; male; medical information; midwife; Peru; primary health care; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; rural area; sex ratio; traditional medicine; volunteer","","J.J.

An analysis of new and approved drugs for cancer by the United States Food and Drug Administration over the period of 1981-2002 showed that 62% of these cancer drugs were of natural origin. Natural compounds possess highly diverse and complex molecular structures compared to small molecule synthetic drugs and often provide highly specific biological activities likely derived from the rigidity and high number of chiral centers. Ethnotraditional use of plant-derived natural products has been a major source for discovery of potential medicinal agents. A number of native Andean and Amazonian medicines of plant origin are used as traditional medicine in Peru to treat different diseases. Of particular interest in this mini-review are three plant materials endemic to Peru with the common names of Cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa), Maca (Lepidium meyenii), and Dragon's blood (Croton lechleri) each having been scientifically investigated for a wide range of therapeutic uses including as specific anti-cancer agents as originally discovered from the long history of traditional usage and anecdotal information by local population groups in South America. Against this background, we present an evidence-based analysis of the chemistry, biological properties, and anti-tumor activities for these three plant materials. In addition, this review will discuss areas requiring future study and the inherent limitations in their experimental use as anti-cancer agents. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Anti-tumor; Cancer; Croton lechleri; Lepidium meyenii; Peruvian medicinal plants; Uncaria tomentosa","alkaloid derivative; anthocyanin; antineoplastic agent; catechin; clerodane derivative; croblongifolin; Croton lechleri extract; crotonin; crovatin; cyanidin 3 rutinoside; dehydrocrotonin; diterpene; glucosinolate; isothiocyanic acid derivative; labdane; Lepidium latifolium extract; Lepidium meyenii extract; natural product; new drug; nidorellol; oxindole; phenanthrene derivative; phytosterol; plant extract; pteropodine; sitosterol; taspine; Uncaria tomentosa extract; uncarine f; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antineoplastic activity; cancer; cancer chemotherapy; chemical structure; Croton lechleri; drug absorption; drug activity; drug approval; drug design; evidence based practice; food and drug administration; higher plant; human; infection; Lepidium; Lepidium latifolium; Lepidium meyenii; medicinal plant; nonhuman; Peru; review; South America; Uncaria tomentosa; United States","","G.F.

As a strategy for improvement of the assessment of their pharmacological and toxicological profile, scientific evidence-based approaches are being employed to appropriately evaluate composition, quality, potential medicinal activity and safety of these natural products. Using this approach, we comprehensively reviewed existing scientific evidence for known composition, medicinal uses (past and present), and documented biological effects with emphasis on clinical pharmacology and toxicology of two commonly used medicinal plants from South America with substantial human exposure from historical and current global use: Uncaria tomentosa (common name: cat's claw, and Spanish: uña de gato), and Lepidium meyenii (common name: maca). Despite the geographic sourcing from remote regions of the tropical Amazon and high altitude Andean mountains, cat's claw and maca are widely available commercially in industrialised countries. Analytical characterisations of their active constituents have identified a variety of classes of compounds of toxicological, pharmacological and even nutritional interest including oxindole and indole alkaloids, flavonoids, glucosinolates, sterols, polyunsaturated fatty acids, carbolines and other compounds. The oxindole alkaloids from the root bark of cat's claw are thought to invoke its most widely sought-after medicinal effects as a herbal remedy against inflammation. We find the scientific evidence supporting this claim is not conclusive and although there exists a base of information addressing this medicinal use, it is limited in scope with some evidence accumulated from in vitro studies towards understanding possible mechanisms of action by specific oxindole alkaloids through inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation. Although controlled clinical studies have demonstrated reduction in pain associated with cat's claw intake in patients with various chronic inflammatory disorders, there is insufficient clinical data overall to draw a firm conclusion for its anti-inflammatory effects. An important observation was that experimental results were often dependent upon the nature of the preparation used. It appears that the presence of unknown substances has an important role in the overall effects of cat's claw extracts is an important factor for consideration. The available animal toxicological studies did not indicate severe toxicity from oral intake of cat's claw preparations but rather were suggestive of a low potential for acute and subacute oral toxicity, and a lack of evidence to demonstrate genotoxic potential and mutagenic activity. Maca is a clear example of a herb with substantial medicinal use in traditional herbal medicine by indigenous cultures in South America since the first recorded knowledge of it in the seventeenth century. The hypocotyls of maca are the edible part of the plant used for nutritional and proposed fertility-enhancing properties. Maca has been described to possess many other medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine but only a few of them have been well studied scientifically. Published clinical studies of maca seem to be related to its property as a nutrient, for male fertility and for energy. There are inadequate data regarding the precise mechanism of action of maca. Some studies suggest that secondary metabolites found in maca extracts are important constituents responsible for its physiological effects. Maca has been reported in the scientific literature to have a low degree of acute oral toxicity in animals and low cellular toxicity in vitro. An important finding unveiled by this review is the importance of standardisation in quality and additional basic and clinical research to scientifically validate and understand composition, biological activity, safety and risk. Development of a comprehensive pharmacological and toxicological profile through critical evaluation of existing and future experimental data, especially carefully conducted clinical studies would facilitate the scientific evidence-based approach to understanding potential biological effects of these major traditionally based herbals in current global use. © 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

However, overdosage leading to toxic reactions occurs despite the broadcasting of a clinically accepted dosage that is effective and safe. The intoxication of a 10-year-old girl in Pucallpa, who had received ojé in a dose close to the recommended one, led us to study retrospectively the records of all hospitalized patients with toxic reactions to ojé over a 12-year-period. The use of ojé in and around Pucallpa was estimated. Most cases with toxic reactions, out of a total of 39 for the 12-year-period, were probably due to an overdose, defined as more than 1.5 cm3/kg; the recommended dose being 1 cm3/kg. In only five cases did toxic reactions occur at doses up to 1.5 cm3/kg, which were interpreted as idiosyncratic reactions; all of them occurred in children, and in two cases it was a severe reaction. One fatal outcome was noted among the 37 hospitalized patients. Two other fatal outcomes were observed in the 12-year-period but they occurred outside the hospital. The mortality rate is estimated to have been 0.01-0.015% among patients supposedly treated with ojé in the area. Severe intoxication led to symptoms of cerebral edema. The main treatment was osmotic diuresis with mannitol which started in 1996. Although hypersensitivity reactions have been observed with other Ficus spp., there was apparently no such reaction in our cases. Recommendations are given so as to avoid toxic reactions from an expected continued use of ojé. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This oxidative damage has an important etiological role in aging and the development of diseases like cancer, atherosclerosis, and other inflammatory disorders. Synthetic antioxidants, like butylated hydroxyanisole, are good free radical scavengers, however, the synthetic antioxidants can be carcinogenic. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in searching for antioxidants of natural origin. We report here the results of a screening for antioxidant activity of 53 ethanolic extracts from 40 Peruvian plants used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several infectious and inflammatory diseases. The antioxidant activity in vitro was measured by means of the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay. Rutin, a natural antioxidant, was used as a control.

We administered a face-to-face survey questionnaire to 116 patients with suspected and proven tuberculosis (TB) in northern Lima to determine the extent to which the use of traditional therapies from indigenous regions persists and the impact of any such use on TB control. Sixty-three percent of participants reported some form of self-treatment prior to presentation to the National Tuberculosis Program; 52% of them used traditional remedies. Symptom duration was longer among self-remedy users than non-users (median = 25 versus 15 days; P = 0.07) and among those exclusively using western remedies rather than traditional remedies (median = 30 versus 15 days; P = 0.01). We thus found no evidence that use of traditional remedies has an appreciable effect on diagnostic delay in Lima.

Currently, Uncaria tomentosa is in demand as tea, tablets or capsules in more than 30 countries outside Perú, as well as in side the country. Pharmacognosy studies are required to determine the comparative morphoanatomical and micrographic features for identification and quality control purposes. Several microscopic parameters, including phloem fibers, calcium oxalate crystals, starch granules, trichomes, and foliar architecture should be considered.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the antioxidative and antiinflammatory properties of cat's claw, Uncaria tomentosa (UT) and Uncaria guianensis (UG). Alkaloids and flavanols were determined using reversed-phase HPLC; scavenging of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrilhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl radicals, and lipid peroxidation by spectrophotometry; and TNFα production by ELISA. Anti-inflammatory activity was assessed in vitro by inhibition of TNFα and nitrite production from RAW 264.7 cells exposed to LPS (50 ng/ml) and in vivo using the indomethacin-induced gastritis model. Apoptosis was assessed using the TUNEL technique and TNFα mRNA by in situ RT-PCR. In each of the antioxidant assays tested, UG was more potent than UT (P < 0.01). The total oxindole and pentacyclic alkaloid content of UT was 35-fold > UG. The IC<inf>50</inf> value for inhibition of TNFα production was significantly (P < 0.01) higher for UT (14.1 ng/ml) vs UG (9.5 ng/ml), yet at concentrations that were considerable lower than that required for antioxidant activity. Non-alkaloid HPLC fractions from UT decreased LPS-induced TNFα and nitrite production in RAW 264.7 cells (P < 0.01) at a concentration range comparable to the parent botanical. Oral pretreatment for 3 d with UT protected against indomethacin-induced gastritis, and prevented TNFα mRNA expression and apoptosis. These results indicate that while both species of cat's claw provide effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, U. guianensis is more potent. In conclusion, the presence of oxindole or pentacyclic alkaloids did not influence the antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties of cat's claw.","Antioxidant; Cat's claw; Free radical; Gastritis; Inflammation; NSAID; TNFα","1,1 diphenyl 2 picrilhydrazyl; alkaloid; free radical; hydroxyl radical; indometacin; nitrite; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; oxindole; pentacyclic alkaloid; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; antioxidant; diagnostic agent; lipopolysaccharide; messenger RNA; plant extract; primer DNA; scavenger; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; apoptosis; article; cell protection; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gastritis; herbal medicine; inflammation; lipid peroxidation; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; stomach epithelium; traditional medicine; uncaria guianensis; Uncaria tomentosa; animal; bark; cell culture; chemically induced disorder; chemistry; drug effect; high performance liquid chromatography; human; IC 50; male; mouse; nick end labeling; pathology; phytotherapy; Sprague Dawley rat; Animalia; Felis catus; Uncaria guianensis; Alkaloids; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Cat's Claw; Cells, Cultured; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; DNA Primers; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Free Radical Scavengers; Gastritis; Humans; Hydroxyl Radical; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; Indomethacin; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Lipid Peroxidation; Lipopolysaccharides; Male; Mice; Phytotherapy; Plant Bark; Plant Extracts; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","","M.
