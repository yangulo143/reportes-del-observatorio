This study explores the experiences of a Quechua-speaking Indigenous community on Amantaní Island, Peru, through a critical medical anthropology lens. Employing a participatory approach, we engaged with community members to explore the multifaceted impacts of COVID-19 on their health and wellbeing. Local facilitators used participatory methods to collect qualitative data from 10 men and 8 women during 2-day gender-segregated workshops within a larger four-year research study. The data were analysed thematically. Our findings reveal that COVID-19 intensified economic instability, social isolation, and educational disparities in Amantaní, with significant impacts on wellbeing. The interruption of tourism, a primary income source, caused severe financial hardship, while lockdowns disrupted social cohesion and access to services. Despite these challenges, the Amantaní communities implemented autonomous coping strategies: reviving ancestral practices such as bartering, developing new income-generating activities, and leveraging social networks for support. This study underscores the importance of addressing the structural determinants of health and integrating Indigenous knowledge systems into public health strategies. By highlighting pre-existing systemic inequities and community strengths, we advocate for equity-driven pandemic preparedness and response, emphasising the need for culturally competent healthcare and inclusive policymaking.","community-based participatory research; COVID-19; health equity; Indigenous health","adult; American Indian; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemiology; ethnology; female; health disparity; human; male; middle aged; pandemic; Peru; psychology; qualitative research; Adult; COVID-19; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Qualitative Research","","","","","17441692; 17441706","","","41292101","English","Glob Public Health","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105023018356"

In this context, Antenatal care (ANC) could have been limited in the general population, especially among indigenous communities. Objective: To determine differences in compliance with adequate ANC based on ethnic groups in Peru prior to and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Observational, retrospective study, secondary analysis of the Demographic and Family Health Survey conducted in the course the period 2017–2022. The sample consisted of women of childbearing age from 15 to 49 years and considered the variables of ethnicity, ANC, and sociodemographic factors. For statistical analysis, generalized linear models from the Poisson family utilizing a logarithmic link function were used. Crude and adjusted Prevalence Ratios were calculated along with their 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 20,165 records were reviewed. Before the pandemic, the frequency of inadequate ANC was 57.91%, and during the pandemic, it increased to 64.91%. Compared to mestizos, belonging to the Quechua ethnic group (PR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.04–1.13), Aymara (PR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.12–1.30), natives of the Amazon (PR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.04–1.27), and those belonging to other races (PR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.02–1.29) had a higher prevalence of inadequate ANC. During the pandemic, only Aymara women maintained a higher prevalence of inadequate ANC (PR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.06–1.31). Conclusions: Before the pandemic, there were ethnic differences in the prevalence of inadequate ANC, and during the pandemic, only Aymara pregnant women maintained a higher prevalence of inadequate ANC. © The Author(s) 2025.

The aim of this statement is to summarize available evidence on access barriers contributing to these inequities, effective solutions that have been deployed and tested, and present key recommendations to advance the field. Methods: We conducted a scoping review searching Medline, Embase, CINHAL, PubMed, Scopus, and Informit Indigenous Collection using the broad search terms “stroke” and “Indigenous” without date restriction until 1 August 2024. We screened 673 unique titles, 96 abstracts, and 80 full-text papers of which we retained 41. We added 10 additional key references known to authors. Articles were analyzed to identify key cross-cutting themes. Results: We identified five key themes: (1) Historical context, colonization and racism; (2) wholistic strength-based approaches to health, well-being, and recovery; (3) communication, health literacy, and cultural safety; (4) Indigenous knowledge systems, research principles, and community-led action; (5) achieving local acceptance versus wide generalizability. Recommendations: Key priority areas, detailed in the form of 11 specific recommendations and based on six core values, include improving stroke service responsiveness, Indigenous Peoples empowerment, and Indigenous research support to better meet the needs of Indigenous Populations globally.

This study aimed to evaluate the mediating role of educational level on ethnic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination status in Peru. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study based on Peru's 2022 National Household Survey. Vaccination status was defined as receiving ‘zero doses’ versus ‘one or more doses’. Education level was categorized as low education (none or primary) and high education (secondary and higher). A 4-way decomposition analysis using interventional analogues was performed to assess the mediating and moderating roles of educational attainment in the association between self-reported ethnicity (Indigenous vs Mestizos, and Afro-Peruvian vs Mestizos) and COVID-19 vaccination status. Results: A total of 51,505 adults were included. Mestizo was self-reported as the most common ethnicity (57.9%), followed by Indigenous (34.1%) and Afro-Peruvian (8.0%). Indigenous and Afro-Peruvians had an absolute risk of not receiving any COVID-19 vaccination that was 14 and 28 percentage points higher, respectively, in comparison to Mestizo ethnicity. About 30% of the observed disparity was mediated through education level in both ethnic contrasts. The contributions of reference and mediated interactions were negligible, indicating an absence of intersectionality in this disparity. Conclusion: The ethnic disparity in adult COVID-19 vaccination coverage between Afro-Peruvians and Mestizos is twice as large as the disparity between Indigenous people and Mestizos. Increasing education levels for minority Peruvians would substantially diminish ethnic disparities in vaccination coverage. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Education; Ethnicity; Mediation analysis; Peru; Vaccination","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; ancestry group; Article; chronic disease; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; decomposition; disability; education; educational status; ethnic group; ethnicity; female; health behavior; health care access; health care personnel; health care policy; health care system; health disparity; health survey; Hispanic; household; household income; human; human experiment; indigenous people; logistic regression analysis; male; mediation analysis; Mestizo; middle aged; outcome assessment; pandemic; people of mixed ancestry; Peru; Peruvian; poverty; prevalence; public health; questionnaire; residence characteristics; risk factor; self report; smoking; social determinants of health; social status; socioeconomics; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; adolescent; aged; epidemiology; ethnology; health care disparity; immunology; prevention and control; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination coverage; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Ethnicity; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccination Coverage; Young Adult","","A.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how sociodemographic conditions influence unequal vaccination coverage with booster doses against COVID-19 in Peru. Methods: A retrospective, ecological study with an evaluation of 196 provinces in Peru. The sociodemographic conditions were evaluated as sources of inequality (sex, age group, educational level, residence area, and ethnic group). The inequality measure used was the GINI, an index that show the inequal vaccination coverage with third and fourth booster doses against COVID-19 in Peruvians provinces. The index allow determinate a higher inequality when the value is near to 1, and a lower inequality when the value is near to 0. Also, the impact of each sociodemographic condition in the general inequality was evaluate with a decomposition analysis of GINI coefficient into Sk (composition effect), Gk (redistribution effect), Rk (differential effect). Results: In provinces evaluated the mean vaccine coverage for the third and fourth booster doses was 57.00% and 22.19%, respectively at twelve months since the beginning of vaccination campaign. The GINI coefficient was 0.33 and 0.31, for the third and fourth booster doses coverage, respectively. In the decomposition analysis, twelve months after the start of the third and fourth dose vaccination campaign, revealed higher Sk values for people living in rural areas (Sk = 0.94 vs. Sk = 2.39, respectively for third and fourth dose), while higher Gk values for Aymara (Gk = 0.92 vs. Gk = 0.92, respectively), Quechua (Gk = 0.53 vs. Gk = 0.53, respectively), and Afro-Peruvians (Gk = 0.61 vs. Gk = 0.61, respectively). Also, higher negative correlation in Rk values for people with elementary education (Rk=-0.43 vs. Rk=-0.33, respectively), aged between 15 and 19 years (Rk=-0.49 vs. Rk=-0.37, respectively), and Aymara (Rk=-0.51 vs. Rk=-0.66, respectively). Conclusion: The rural residency area, lower education and Quechua, Aymara or Afro-Peruvians ethnicity determinated inequalities in vaccination coverage with booster doses against COVID-19 in Peruvian provinces. © W.

However, the marginalization-related diminished returns theory suggests that increases in SES yield smaller health gains for marginalized populations—such as Afro-Peruvian and Indigenous groups—compared to majority groups like Mestizos, largely due to systemic barriers and social disadvantage. Therefore, the current study aimed to explore ethnic disparities in the association between maternal SES on childhood anemia in Peru. Methods: Using data from the 2017 to 2023 Peruvian Demographic and Health Survey, we conducted a cross-sectional study including children aged 6–59 months with their respective mothers. Ethnicity was grouped into Mestizo, Afro-Peruvian, and Indigenous (Quechua, Aimara, and native of the Amazon). Three proxies of SES were used: wealth index, level of education, and years of education. After stratifying by ethnicity, we estimated prevalence ratios (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using generalized linear models with Poisson family. Interaction was assessed on multiplicative and additive scales. Findings: Among 234,364 Peruvian mothers, 45.7% (n = 107,118) identified as Mestizo, 12.6% (n = 29,557) as Afro-Peruvian, and 41.7% (n = 97,689) as Indigenous. The overall prevalence of anemia in children was 32.2%. The association between a very rich wealth index and lower prevalence of anemia was weaker among Indigenous (PR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.56–0.72) compared to Mestizo individuals (PR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.42–0.50). Similarly, the association between higher maternal education and lower anemia prevalence was less pronounced for Afro-Peruvian (PR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.62–0.79) and Indigenous groups (PR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.77–0.86) than for Mestizos (PR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.59–0.67). A similar pattern was noted with maternal years of education (Mestizos [PR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.94–0.96], Afro-Peruvian [PR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96–0.98], and Indigenous [PR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.98–0.99]). Interaction analysis confirmed significantly weaker associations for Afro-Peruvian and Indigenous individuals compared to Mestizos. Interpretation: Maternal SES is associated with lower prevalence of childhood anemia, with stronger associations observed among Mestizo populations compared to Afro-Peruvian and Indigenous groups. This pattern aligns with the marginalization-related diminished returns theory. Maximizing SES alone does not preclude ethnic disparities but rather, may even widen them, highlighting the need for equity-focused interventions that address underlying structural and systemic barriers.

The study describes the factors that limit institutional childbirth among Ashaninka mothers in the Peruvian Amazon. METHODS The research was descriptive, using a questionnaire administered to 152 Ashaninka mothers from five communities in Río Tambo. RESULTS Most Ashaninka mothers who gave birth at home were between 25 and 29 years old, lived with their partners, came from the Koterini Tarzo community, were Catholic, had incomplete secondary education, were housewives, and had a paternal income of less than or equal to 1000 PEN. They chose home birth for cultural reasons such as privacy, tradition, and economics, preferring traditional birth attendants because of their cultural acceptance and experience. Cultural practices included the burial of the placenta, the use of herbs such as “piri piri,” and vertical births. The perception of inadequate facilities and the prevalence of cesarean sections limit the acceptance of institutional childbirth. Added to this is a preference for female healthcare personnel, a lack of information about health procedures, and the prohibition of cultural practices. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to reform the maternal care model in Indigenous contexts, involving healthcare personnel, policymakers, and local authorities to create culturally relevant and accessible services. It is suggested that an intercultural approach be integrated into professional training and that traditional medicine be combined with the healthcare system. Future studies should evaluate the impact of these interventions on maternal and perinatal outcomes in Indigenous communities. © 2025, Medwave Estudios Ltda.

Peru, one of the most biodiverse and culturally rich countries worldwide, is uniquely vulnerable to these effects due to its diverse ecosystems each facing distinct climate challenges. Yet research on the lived experiences of rural and Indigenous Peruvian women facing these impacts is scarce. We aim to explore the perspectives and experiences of underserved Peruvian women regarding the effects of climate change, and the needs, assets, and community responses to these threats. Methods: Between April and May 2022, we conducted 48 in-depth walking interviews with adult women from the Peruvian north coast, Amazon rainforest, and central and southern Andes regions. Using purposive and iterative snowball sampling, we recruited community key informants. We analysed the data thematically. Findings: Our analysis identified four main themes: (1) Local understanding of environmental changes, (2) Gendered impacts of climate change, (3) Women's participation in environmental governance, and (4) Pathways for gender-responsive climate action. Participants described vivid observations of environmental shifts, often attributing these to local human activities. Women reported increased caregiving responsibilities and economic vulnerabilities due to climate-related events. Barriers to women's participation in environmental decision-making were identified, including traditional gender roles and lack of voice in community forums. Participants highlighted the need for capacity building, leadership development, and integration of indigenous knowledge in climate action. Interpretation: This study underscores the imperative of centring gender equity and social justice in climate change adaptation and environmental governance. Findings highlight the urgent need to address systemic barriers, rebuild institutional trust, and adopt an intersectional, community-centric approach responsive to marginalised women's realities and priorities. Health systems should prepare for the mental health impacts of climate-related events on women, particularly increased anxiety and depression linked to resource insecurity and caregiving burdens. Policymakers should develop gender-responsive disaster preparedness plans, strengthen women's representation in environmental decision-making bodies, and create culturally appropriate climate communication strategies that integrate Indigenous knowledge systems. Implementation of targeted leadership training programs for women and establishing community-based environmental monitoring systems would enhance climate resilience while addressing gender inequities.

Aims: To characterize and find the factors associated with the use of medicinal plants in Honduras. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was carried out by means of Physicians in Social Service (MSS) in hospitals and health institutions; 16,379 respondents were reached in all departments of Honduras, who were asked about their general characteristics, use of medicinal plants and other similar characteristics; descriptive and analytical statistics were obtained. Results: 87.9% (14,398) mentioned that they had used medicinal plants. Their use was higher in the female population (p<0.001), living in a rural area (p<0.001), having been treated with natural medicine (p<0.001), among those who recommended that others be treated with medicinal plants (p<0.001) and those who thought that plants are cheaper than pharmacological treatments (p=0.042); on the contrary, those who thought that drugs were cheaper (p<0.001), those who did not know about the prices (p<0.001) and those who perceived that natural medicine care was cheaper (p<0.001) used fewer natural treatments; adjusted for four variables. Conclusions: The study identified key characteristics and factors associated with the use of medicinal plants in Honduras. These findings offer valuable insights for public health officials and policymakers, especially in countries with similar cultural and socioeconomic contexts within Central America. Understanding the prevalence and types of alternative medicine used across urban and rural populations can help guide health interventions and integrate traditional medicine into public health strategies. © 2025 Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmacognosy Research.","alternative medicine; Honduras; medicinal plants; traditional medicine","herbaceous agent; natural product; adult; advertising; age; Aloe vera; alternative medicine; anise; Article; book; cinnamon; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; drug cost; drug use; ethnicity; Eucalyptus; female; garlic; ginger; health care facility; health survey; Honduras; human; Internet; lemon; male; Matricaria chamomilla; medicinal plant; multivariate analysis; personal experience; prevalence; residence characteristics; rural area; sex; tea; traditional medicine; urban area","","E.

This definition is inseparable from relativism of cultural determinants. Aims: This review aimed to synthesize the relevant aspects of the influence of culture on clinical practice and health management for this condition, aligning them to the ICD-11 PD model. Method: In Scopus, we systematically searched for studies that included the text strings: cultur* | personality AND (disorder* OR patholog*) without any restrictions on publication date or language or other exclusion criteria, up to November 2022. Results: Evidence suggests that cultural variables in ethnic groups (Western and non-Western) such as the individualist/collectivist philosophy, historical/generational trauma, immigration, acculturation, religion, and gender influence the etiology, semiology, epidemiology, evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and management of health services for ICD-11 PD. We discuss the limitations and propose future lines of research on this topic based on our knowledge and experience. In this review, we provide the scientific community and clinicians with relevant cultural information to guide their practice and propose strategies to manage PD from the ICD-11 model.

This population has demonstrated reduced healthcare access due to discrimination and differential treatment, reflecting broader societal inequities. Objective: This study explores the experiences and perceptions of Afro-Peruvian individuals regarding the treatment they receive from public primary healthcare providers in metropolitan Lima. Methods: In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with Afro-Peruvian individuals recruited from Lima. They were selected based on their responses to a survey conducted in a previous study, which indicated a high or low perception of intercultural adaptation in healthcare. The interviews explored their experiences with healthcare services and their perceptions about their interactions with health providers. The qualitative analysis involved topic coding to interpret the data. Results: We interviewed 19 Afro-Peruvians, including 15 women and 4 men, ages 26 to 70. The findings reveal that Afro-Peruvians generally experience mistreatment in the healthcare system. In their opinion, this is associated with systemic issues such as poor infrastructure, low salaries, and insufficient time allocated for patient care. Furthermore, participants perceive receiving poor quality and inefficient service not only from providers but also from the system presents difficulties in other processes, such as getting the appointment. Conclusions: This study highlights significant areas for improvement in the public healthcare system, specifically enhancing the quality of patient care, improving communication, and upgrading healthcare infrastructure to serve the Afro-Peruvian community better. These insights could guide the development of targeted policy recommendations and practical interventions to address healthcare disparities and improve access to quality healthcare services for minority populations. © The Author(s), 2025.","Afro-Peruvian; health systems; healthcare access; healthcare disparities; minority populations; patient experiences; patient-provider interaction; primary health care; public health; qualitative research","adult; article; controlled study; female; health care access; health care disparity; health care personnel; health care quality; health care system; health infrastructure; health service; human; interview; male; minority group; patient care; perception; Peru; Peruvian; primary health care; primary medical care; public health; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; salary; aged; Black person; middle aged; psychology; Adult; Aged; Black People; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Quality of Health Care","","M.S.

The Intercultural Birth Policy was introduced in 2005 to ensure that Indigenous women give birth at a health facility, where doctors could save their lives in the case of an obstetric emergency. Intercultural health policies have at their heart the right of Indigenous people to receive health services that are respectful and cognizant of their medical knowledges and practices, and aim to challenge the subordinate position of Indigenous cultures. Through a qualitative study conducted in 2023 in the Peruvian Amazon, we explored the challenges and limitations of the implementation of this policy two decades after its introduction. We found a superficial and instrumental understanding of the policy by health workers, with the cultural adaptation of maternal care seen as a favor, not a right. Indigenous women experience discrimination and disdain towards their medical practices, which alienates them from the services to which they are entitled. © 2025 The Author(s).

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 211 Quechua-speaking postmenopausal women from the Chontayoc community (Huaraz-Peru, 3139 m asl), who suffered from depression and refused either pharmacologic treatment or psychotherapeutic treatment. A questionnaire was administered between April and September 2024, following voluntary informed consent and approval by the ethics committee. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 24. The χ2 test was applied with a significance level of 0.05. Results: The majority of postmenopausal women (123, 58.3%) refused pharmacologic treatment for depression, while 162 (76.8%) and 181 (85.8%) women expressed distrust of the professional competence of health personnel and preference for the use of traditional medicine, respectively. The institutional and cultural factors that showed a statistically significant relationship with the rejection of depression treatment were distrust of the professional competence of health personnel, health care in a language other than Quechua, fear of treatment, distrust of its effectiveness, little information provided by health personnel, preference for the use of traditional medicine, shame and fear of community rejection, belief that depression treatment causes madness, and belief that depression is normal in postmenopausal women (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Institutional and cultural factors are associated with the rejection of depression treatment in Quechua-speaking indigenous postmenopausal women from the Chontayoc community, so multisectoral intervention measures with an intercultural approach are required. © 2025 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.","depression; indigenous people; menopause; mental health","","","A.F.

This study aimed to elucidate the clinical course and practices of CCA in Latin America. Methods: This observational cohort study investigated individuals diagnosed with CCA between 2010 and 2023 at five referral centres across Latin America. Demographic, biochemical, and clinical data were analysed. Findings: A total of 309 patients were enrolled, demonstrating a balanced distribution of CCA subtypes (intrahepatic, perihilar, and distal), with Hispanics and Caucasians as the predominant ethnic groups, followed by Africans. Major risk factors identified included age, diabetes, obesity, MASLD, bile duct stones, and cholecystitis. Disparities in overweight/obesity prevalence were noted among CCA subtypes and ethnicities, with higher rates in extrahepatic CCA and among Hispanics and Caucasians. At diagnosis, 72% of patients had ECOG-PS scores of 0–1, with disease presentations ranging from localized (47%) to locally advanced (19%) and metastatic (34%). Patients who did not receive any anti-cancer therapy exhibited a median survival of 2.3 months. Survival rates significantly improved across treatment modalities, with surgery yielding the longest (34 months), followed by chemotherapy (8 months). Notably, Africans presented with worse ECOG-PS scores and more advanced disease, while Hispanics were less frequently treated with chemotherapy for advanced disease, contributing to lower survival rates (8.3 and 6 months, respectively) compared to Caucasians (12.6 months). Interpretation: The high prevalence of late-stage CCA diagnosis in Latin America, particularly among individuals of African ethnicity, coupled with a significant proportion of Hispanic patients not receiving chemotherapy, underscores the dismal prognosis for these patients. These findings reveal structural challenges in cancer screening and healthcare access among diverse ethnic backgrounds and lower socioeconomic statuses in the region. Urgent measures are needed, including the identification of preventable risk factors, raising awareness among high-risk populations, and establishing equitable health coverage to address these disparities.

Dichas prácticas reflejaron su formación en salud intercultural y su capacidad para adecuar las normas establecidas por el Ministerio de Salud. En función de los síntomas observados en los pacientes, los enfermeros indígenas usaron una variedad de prácticas: vaporaciones, masajes, baños, infusiones y remedios. Las nociones de salud y enfermedad que los enfermeros técnicos indígenas comparten con sus pacientes fueron la base para interpretar el Covid-19 y estuvieron presentes en las atenciones brindadas. Esto se nutrió de la existencia de un sistema de cuidado familiar bastante articulado que fue tejiéndose y siendo negociado en función de los síntomas y las terapias aplicadas. Sus prácticas demuestran la creatividad en los pueblos indígenas. En ese sentido, el sector salud necesita repensar su mirada sobre la medicina indígena, a la que denomina “tradicional” y nos muestra la necesidad de repensar las ideas sobre adecuación de los servicios para la población indígena para colocar en el centro del debate el significado de interculturalidad en salud desde la perspectiva indígena. © 2024 Society for Public Health Education.","COVID-19; indigenous people; intercultural health; Peru; primary health care","coronavirus disease 2019; diagnosis; indigenous people; Peru; primary health care; review; adult; American Indian; attitude to health; cultural competence; ethnology; female; human; indigenous health care; interview; male; organization and management; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; traditional medicine; transcultural care; Adult; COVID-19; Cultural Competency; Culturally Competent Care; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services, Indigenous; Humans; Indians, South American; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medicine, Traditional; SARS-CoV-2","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by the Swiss Programme for Research on Global Issues for Development funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation grant IZ08Z0_177385.","M.A. Pesantes; Department of Anthropology and Archaeology, Dickinson College, Carlisle, United States; email: pesantma@dickinson.edu","","SAGE Publications Inc.","10901981; 15526127","","HEDBF","39360514","English","Health Educ.

Methods: Data from the 2017–2023 Demographic and Family Health Survey in Peru were analyzed to evaluate ethnic disparities in screening coverage for breast and cervical cancer, including clinical breast examination (CBE), Pap smear test (PST), and mammography. Measures such as the GINI coefficient and Slope Index of Inequality (SII) were used to quantify coverage and utilization disparities among ethnic groups. Results: The study included 70,454 women aged 30–69. Among women aged 40–69, 48.31% underwent CBE, 84.06% received PST, and 41.69% underwent mammography. It was found inequalities in coverage for any cancer screening (GINI: 0.10), mammography (GINI: 0.21), CBE (GINI: 0.19), and PST (GINI: 0.06), in 25 Peruvian regions. These inequalities were more pronounced in regions with larger populations of Quechua, Aymara, and Afro-Peruvian women. In rural areas, Quechua or Aymara women (SII: -0.83, -0.95, and − 0.69, respectively) and Afro-Peruvian women (SII: -0.80, -0.92, and − 0.58, respectively) experienced heightened inequalities in the uptake of CBE, mammography, and PST, respectively. Like Quechua or Aymara women (SII: -0.50, SII: -0.52, and SII: -0.50, respectively) and Afro-Peruvian women (SII: -0.50, SII: -0.58, and SII: -0.44, respectively) with only a primary education. Conclusion: Ethnic inequalities affect breast and cervical cancer screening coverage across regions in Peru. In Quechua, Aymara, and Afro-Peruvian women the uptake of mammography, CBE, and PST was less frequently than their white or mestizo counterparts. These inequalities are attributed to sociodemographic conditions such as lower education levels and residence in rural or non-capital areas. © The Author(s) 2024.","Early detection of cancer; Ethnicity; Health inequities; Peru; Sociodemographic factors","adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; breast examination; cancer risk; cancer screening; cross-sectional study; economic inequality; ethnic group; ethnicity; family health; female; geographic distribution; health care personnel; health insurance; health survey; human; major clinical study; mammography; rural area; sensitivity analysis; social status; sociodemographics; uterine cervix cancer; breast tumor; diagnosis; early cancer diagnosis; ethnology; health care disparity; middle aged; Papanicolaou test; Peru; socioeconomics; uterine cervix tumor; vagina smear; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Ethnicity; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Mammography; Middle Aged; Papanicolaou Test; Socioeconomic Factors; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vaginal Smears","","C.

Since ancient times, the origin and development of natural and traditional medicine have been intrinsically linked to humanity struggle for survival. Nowadays, ethnobotanical studies are employed as a tool for the preservation and conservation not only of taxonomic biodiversity but also of cultural biodiversity. Methodology: A descriptive research with a quantitative, non-experimental cross-sectional design was carried out. The study was conducted in six Quechua-speaking communities in the district of Incahuasi (3,000 meters above sea level), selected for convenience considering factors such as altitude, accessibility, and proximity to the city. A questionnaire was administered to 32 residents from the communities, who shared their knowledge about medicinal plants, providing relevant information about them. The gender of the participants was considered because men and women use traditional medicine and the knowledge of them is transmitted from parents to children. Results: During the study, a total of 46 medicinal species were recorded, belonging to 42 genera and 22 botanical families. The most representative medicinal families used by the informants of the communities were Asteraceae (30.4%) and Lamiaceae (15.2%). It is also worth mentioning the genera Salvia and Baccharis, with three and two species respectively, which are commonly used to treat various ailments and diseases. Conclusions: Ethnobotanical information was collected on the medicinal plants used by the community members of the selected communities in Incahuasi, and the corresponding data were recorded. A total of 46 plants were collected, with the majority belonging to the Asteraceae and Lamiaceae families. ©: © 2024 Morales Ramos JG et al.","ethnobotany; medicinal plants; systematic botany; Traditional medicine","adult; altitude; Article; Asteraceae; Baccharis; conservation biology; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cultural diversity; descriptive research; ethnobotany; female; health care access; human; knowledge; Lamiaceae; male; medical information; medicinal plant; middle aged; nonhuman; pilot study; preservation; quantitative analysis; Quechua (people); questionnaire; Salvia; sea level; species diversity; traditional medicine; urban population; child; phytotherapy; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnobotany; Female; Humans; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Phytotherapy; Plants, Medicinal","","J.G.

Indigenous populations have their own perspectives and interpretations of dietary changes unfolding in their communities. Based on in-depth interviews, observations and validation workshops we explored the way Awajún describe and problematise the concept of healthy and unhealthy food in the context of the nutrition transition. We learn that the characteristics of ‘good food' are informed by their capacity to give strength, protect health and enable them to be hardworking people. On the contrary, food that comes from the city weakens the body and may result in health problems. For the Awajún, chicken with hormones, fish preserved in cans, and powdered milk negatively affect their health. We argue that the dichotomy ‘healthy' and ‘unhealthy’ used to classify food provides information not only about Indigenous conceptualisations of health and die, but is also a critique of broader structural processes affecting their well-being.

In rural areas of Amazonian Loreto, access to quality care is difficult, home births are frequent, and neonatal mortality is high. We conducted a prospective before-and-after study to assess the effect after implementation and over time of a community-based intervention on essential newborn care (ENC). Methods: Mamás del Río consists of tablet-enhanced educational home visits by Community health workers (CHW) to pregnant women and mothers of newborns, with supportive training on ENC of traditional birth attendants and facility staff. The study area comprised 79 rural communities of three districts in Loreto. Primary outcomes were ENC practices in home births, secondary outcomes were ENC in facility births as well as healthcare seeking, measured at baseline before and at year 2 and year 3 after intervention implementation. Community censuses included questionnaires to women aged 15–49 years with a live birth. We calculated prevalence of outcomes at each time point and estimated adjusted prevalence differences (PD) between time points using post-estimation based on logistic regression. Findings: Following implementation early 2019, 97% of communities had a trained CHW. At year 2 follow-up, 63% (322/530) of women received a CHW visit during pregnancy. Seven out of nine ENC indicators among home births improved, with largest adjusted prevalence differences in immediate skin-to-skin contact (50% [95% CI: 42–58], p < 0.0001), colostrum feeding (45% [35–54], p < 0.0001), and cord care (19% [10–28], p = 0.0001). Improvements were maintained at year 3, except for cord care. At year 2, among facility births only three ENC indicators improved, while more women gave birth in a facility. Sensitivity analyses showed ENC prevalence was similar before compared to after onset of Covid-19 lockdown. Interpretation: ENC practices in home births improved consistently and changes were sustained over time, despite the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. A community-based approach for behaviour-change in home-based newborn care appears effective. Process evaluation of mechanisms will help to explain observed effects and understand transferability of findings.

Over the past 10 years, there has been a large multi-sectoral initiative to establish a national network of Centros de Emergencia de la Mujer (Women’s Emergency Centres) that integrate health and police services, and substantial increase in efforts from non-governmental organisations in supporting survivors of violence. However, there is currently little evidence on how existing services meet the needs of indigenous women experiencing violence in Peru. Methods: As part of a broader mixed-methods participatory VAWG prevention study, we assessed existing service provision for women experiencing violence in an indigenous Quechua community from Amantaní, Peru. This involved 17 key informant interviews with legal, government, police, and civil society representatives. We used the UN Women Essential Services Package for Women and Girls Subject to Violence framework to guide our analysis. Results: Participants identified major gaps in existing services for indigenous women survivors of violence in Peru. They discussed survivors and perpetrators not being identified by the health system, a lack of IPV response training for health professionals, IPV not being prioritised as a health concern, and a lack of health services that are culturally appropriate for indigenous populations. Survivors who report to police are often treated poorly and discriminated against. Legal systems were perceived as insufficient and ineffective, with inadequate legal measures for perpetrators. While legal and policy frameworks exist, they are often not applied in practice. Service provision in this region needs to adopt an intercultural, rights based, gendered approach to IPV response and prevention, considering cultural and linguistic relevance for indigenous populations. Conclusion: The role of structural violence in perpetuating indigenous women’s experiences of violence and undermining their access to services must be central to designing and implementing appropriate policies and services if they are to meet the needs of indigenous women in Peru. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Emergency services; Health services research; Indigenous health services; Indigenous people; Indigenous populations; Latin America; Mental health services; Peru; Qualitative research; Violence against women","civil society; health services; indigenous population; service provision; training; adult; aggression; article; community; diagnosis; emergency health service; female; government; health service; health services research; human; indigenous health care; indigenous people; interview; mental health service; non-governmental organization; partner violence; Peru; police; prevention; qualitative research; South and Central America; violence; population group; prevention and control; survivor; Latin America; Female; Humans; Intimate Partner Violence; Population Groups; Survivors; Violence","This study was funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) (ref.MR/S033629/1).

As part of an effort to ‘rural proof’ health systems, it is therefore imperative to identify and act on the factors limiting access to health services by rural and indigenous communities. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the wide range of access barriers faced by rural and remote communities in two countries where barrier assessments were conducted. It also discusses the potential for barrier assessments to contribute evidence for rural proofing of national health policies, strategies, plans and programs. Methods: The study applied a concurrent triangulation design to collect and analyze data obtained from narrative-style literature reviews, in-depth interviews with local health authorities, and secondary analyses of existing household data on Guyana and Peru. These two countries were selected because they have some of the largest rural and indigenous populations in Latin America and the Caribbean, and have national policies in place for providing free, essential health services for these communities. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected separately, and results were interpreted together. The main objective was to corroborate and cross-validate findings looking for convergence between the separate data analyses. Results: Seven dominant themes were identified across the two countries: use of traditional medicine and practice; decision making, gender, and family power dynamics; ethnicity and trust; knowledge and health literacy; geographic accessibility, health personnel and intercultural skills; and financial accessibility. The findings suggest that the interaction between these barriers may be as important as the singular role played by each factor, thereby highlighting the complex and multifactorial nature of accessing services in rural settings. Issues with limited availability of human resources for health were compounded by inadequate supplies and infrastructure. Financial barriers were often linked to the indirect costs of transport and geographic location, and further exacerbated by reduced socioeconomic status of rural communities, a majority of which are indigenous and have a strong preference for traditional medicines. Importantly, rural and indigenous communities experience considerable non-financial barriers related to issues of acceptability, which requires adaptation of health personnel and health service delivery models to the context-specific needs and realities of each rural community. Conclusion: This study presented an approach for data collection and analysis that is both feasible and effective for evaluating access barriers in rural and remote communities. While this study explored access barriers through general health services in two rural settings, the issues identified reflect the structural deficiencies of many health systems. These challenges and singularities require adaptive organizational models for the provision of health services that respond to the specific characteristics of rural and indigenous communities. This study indicates the potential relevance of conducting assessments of barriers to health services as part of a wider approach to rural proofing and supports the notion that a mixed-methods approach, linking secondary analysis of existing relevant national survey data with focused key-informant interview data, may be an effective and efficient way to transform data into the knowledge policymakers need to rural proof health policies © 2023, Rural and Remote Health.All Rights Reserved.","access; access barriers; Guyana; health equity; health policies; indigenous population; Latin America and the Caribbean; Peru; rural proofing; universal access to health; universal health coverage","article; Caribbean; data analysis; decision making; ethnicity; female; gender; Guyana; health care personnel; health care policy; health equity; health insurance; health literacy; health service; household; human; interview; male; narrative; Peru; public health; quantitative analysis; rural population; secondary analysis; skill; social status; South and Central America; traditional medicine; trust; information processing; Data Collection; Ethnicity; Health Personnel; Health Policy; Humans; Rural Population","This study was financed by the U.S. Government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under the PAHO– USAID Umbrella Grant Agreement 2016–2021.

To determine the association between the non-use of health services due to mistreatment based on ethnicity in Peru. Methods. Secondary analysis of National Household Survey (ENAHO) for 2019. We used Poisson generalized linear models for complex samples, and calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Collinearity relationships between variables were evaluated in the adjusted model. Results. We analyzed 23,242 subjects. The prevalence of mistreatment was 1.4%, 95% CI 1.2–1.6. Belonging to Quechua or Aymara ethnicity was associated with higher prevalence of mistreatment (aPR 2.60, 95% CI 1.75–3.87 and aPR 2.98 95% CI 1.68– 5.27, respectively). Further, the same was found if patient does or does not speak a native language (aPR 2.28, 95% CI 1.66–3.14). Conclusions. Being a Quechua patient or speaking a native language increased by two times and being of Aymara ethnicity increased by three times the probability of not going to health services due to mistreatment.

Such context-specific information is prerequisite to developing evidence-based health policies and programs intended to improve health outcomes for Indigenous populations. To this end, this study aimed to characterize health-seeking behaviours, factors affecting health-seeking behaviours, and barriers to obtaining healthcare in two Indigenous Shawi communities in Peru. Methods: Community-based approaches guided this work, and included 40 semi-structured interviews and a series of informal interviews. Data were analysed thematically, using a constant comparative method; result authenticity and validity were ensured via team debriefing, member checking, and community validation. Results: Shawi health-seeking behaviours were plural, dynamic, and informed by several factors, including illness type, perceived aetiology, perceived severity, and treatment characteristics. Traditional remedies were preferred over professional biomedical healthcare; however, the two systems were viewed as complementary, and professional biomedical healthcare was sought for illnesses for which no traditional remedies existed. Barriers impeding healthcare use included distance to healthcare facilities, costs, language barriers, and cultural insensitivity amongst professional biomedical practitioners. Nevertheless, these barriers were considered within a complex decision-making process, and could be overridden by certain factors including perceived quality or effectiveness of care. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the importance of acknowledging and considering Indigenous culture and beliefs, as well as the existing traditional medical system, within the professional healthcare system. Cultural competency training and formally integrating traditional healthcare into the official healthcare system are promising strategies to increase healthcare service use, and therefore health outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s).","Health-seeking behaviour; Healthcare access; Indigenous; Intercultural health; Intercultural healthcare; Peru; Shawi","article; communication barrier; constant comparative method; cultural competence; decision making; health care access; health care facility; health care utilization; human; human experiment; Peru; semi structured interview; traditional medicine; validity; health care delivery; health care policy; Hispanic; patient attitude; qualitative research; Delivery of Health Care; Health Policy; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Qualitative Research","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the International Development Research Center of Canada’s International Research Initiative on Adaptation to Climate Change, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia grant, and a grant from the Rivers Foundation through the Scientific Exploration Society.

The dependent variable was HRU (Yes/No) as the main reason for not going to health care facilities. We collected these variables: age, sex, education, marital status, ethnicity, region of residence, chronic diseases or disability, and health insurance. The HRU prevalence was associated with older participants, who lived in the highlands or the jungle, belonged to Quechua or Aymara ethnic groups, and had comprehensive health insurance. In contrast, there was a lower HRU prevalence for those enrolled in private insurance. The HRU was associated with various socio-demographic factors in adults with any symptoms, illness, or accidents not attending health centers. © Meharry Medical College.","Ethnic groups; Health care system; Insurance; Peru; Traditional medicine","adolescent; adult; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; health care delivery; health care facility; human; Peru; socioeconomics; traditional medicine; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Health Facilities; Humans; Medicine, Traditional; Socioeconomic Factors","","V.A.

Methodos:This is a qualitative study on social representations based on the interpretive paradigm and through an in-depth interview, for which a guide of topics or categories was used, based on the objectives of the study. The study population was made up of patients treated in the Endocrinology Units of the Antonio Lorena and Regional Hospitals of Cusco, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and of Quechua origin evidenced by their mother tongue. The sample is non-probabilistic for convenience, the representativeness of the discourse was sought for this, reaching 30 interviews based on the saturation criterion. The information analysis included 1. The transcription (from oral Quechua to written Quechua) and the translation of the interviews and 2. The computerized processing of the interviews, for which purpose the RQDA (Research qualitative data analysis) computer program was used. Results: The ideas that patients have about the cause of their disease and the changes that it produces reflect the influence of Modern Medicine and Andean and Popular Medicine. On the other hand, for the treatment of their disease, they consider it useful to combine the medications that have been indicated in the health service with the resources of Andean and Popular Medicine (medicinal herbs and other natural products). Conclusion: The patients in our study have an intercultural approach to approach and treat. © 2021 The authors.

There is, therefore, a need to better understand context-specific Indigenous understandings of health in order to design culturally appropriate health services. To this end, this study characterized two Shawi communities' understandings of what it means to be healthy. Using a community-based participatory research approach, 40 semi-structured interviews and a series of informal interviews were conducted and analysed thematically, using a constant comparative method. The Shawi definition of health extended beyond individual physical welfare and focused on emotional, collective, and environmental wellbeing. The primary factors underlying Shawi perceptions of health and wellbeing included providing for the family, ensuring the welfare of others, maintaining positive social relationships, preserving traditional values and practices, and living harmoniously with the natural environment. Conversely, Shawi classified illnesses according to their cause or treatment. These included illnesses caused by sorcery, those caused by spirits of the forest, and ‘new diseases,’ that first appeared in the communities when they were contacted by the Western civilization, for which no traditional remedies existed. Consequently, according to Shawi, sociocultural, environmental, and climatic changes are posing imminent health threats. This study highlights the differences between biomedical and Indigenous Shawi health understandings, and therefore emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and embracing Shawi culture and beliefs within the formal healthcare system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Health beliefs; Indigenous; Peru; Public health; Shawi","health belief; health services; indigenous population; public health; Article; awareness; case report; cassava; climate change; clinical article; comprehension; constant comparative method; Cyperaceae; emotionality; female; fever; headache; health care cost; health care personnel; health care system; human; male; participatory research; perception; population growth; qualitative research; religion; semi structured interview; social determinants of health; social interaction; social network; social support; thematic analysis; traditional medicine; welfare; wellbeing; witchcraft; Amazonia; Peru","We express our immense gratitude to the families of the two Shawi communities for welcoming the researchers into their communities and homes.

It was aimed to share and evaluate investigators' experiences on challenges and opportunities on clinical research and pharmacogenetics. Methods: A total of 33 members from 22 countries participated in 2 sessions: RIBEF studies on population pharmacogenetics about the relationship between ancestry with relevant drug-related genetic polymorphisms and the relationship between genotype and phenotype in Native Americans (session 1) and case examples of clinical studies in RLSs from Asia (cancer), America (diabetes and women health), and Africa (malaria) in which the participants were asked to answer in free text their experiences on challenges and opportunities to solve the problems (session 2). Later, a discourse analysis grouping common themes by affinity was conducted. Findings: The main result of session 1 was that the pharmacogenetics-related ancestry of the population should be considered when designing clinical studies in RLSs. In session 2, 21 challenges and 20 opportunities were identified. The social aspects represent the largest proportion of the challenges (43%) and opportunities (55%), and some of them seem to be common. Implications: The main discussion points were gathered in the Declaration of Mérida/T'Hó and announced on the Parliament of Extremadura during the CIOMS-RIBEF meeting in 4 of the major Latin American autochthonous languages (Náhualth, Mayan, Miskito, and Kichwa). The declaration highlighted the following: (1) the relevance of population pharmacogenetics, (2) the sociocultural contexts (interaction with traditional medicine), and (3) the education needs of research teams for clinical research in vulnerable and autochthonous populations. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","CIOMS-RIBEF; clinical research; pharmacogenetics; resource-limited settings","clinical pharmacology; clinical research; Conference Paper; discourse analysis; drug research; ethnicity; genetic polymorphism; genotype phenotype correlation; human; international organization; pharmacogenetics; symposium; Africa; Asia; diabetes mellitus; genetics; genotype; health care planning; malaria; medical research; neoplasm; phenotype; United States; women's health; American Natives; Biomedical Research; Diabetes Mellitus; Genotype; Health Resources; Humans; Malaria; Neoplasms; Pharmacogenetics; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Genetic; Women's Health","The meeting was organized by CIOMS and RIBEF in collaboration with Junta de Extremadura (Foreign Affairs General Direction), the Parliament of Extremadura, the Extremadura Agency for International Development Cooperation AEXCID, PHI Foundation, and the University of Extremadura.

To estimate the proportion of Peruvian women who received quality prenatal care (PNC) for their last childbirth in the last five years and to determine its associated factors. Materials and Methods. Analytical cross-sectional study of the 2017 Demographic and Family Health Survey. The proportion of quality PNC was calculated based on the number of PNC control visits. Bivariate and adjusted prevalence ratios (PRa) of quality PNC were estimated. Results. Data from 18,156 women were analyzed; 56.1% received quality PNC. Receiving more PNC visits increased the likelihood of receiving quality PNC (49.6% and 59.9% for six and eight control visits, respectively). Being from the highlands (PRa=0.85; 95% CI: 0.80-0.91), living in rural areas (PRa=0.94; 95% CI: 0.89-0.99), and belonging to a native ethnic group (PRa=0.72; 95% CI: 0.66-0.79) was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving quality PNC. Having completed high-school (PRa=1.16; 95% CI: 1.10-1.22) and higher education (PRa=1.15; 95% CI: 1.07-1.23), being from the 2nd wealth quintile (PRa=1.15; 95% CI: 1.08-1.22), 3rd quintile (PRa=1.18; 95% CI: 1.09-1.27), 4th quintile (PRa=1.16; 95% CI: 1.07-1.26), and 5th quintile (PRa=1.16; 95% CI: 1.05-1.28); being from the rest of the Coast (PRa=1.06; 95% CI: 1.00-1.12) and Jungle (PRa=1.31; 95% CI: 1.24-1.39); being enrolled in health insurance (PRa=1.24; 95% CI: 1.18-1.30); birth order 2-3 (PRa=1.10; 95% CI: 1.06-1.15) or ≥4 (PRa=1.20; 95% CI: 1.14-1.27), and having received PNC in the first trimester (PRa=1.20, 95% CI: 1.14-1.26) was related to an increased likelihood of receiving quality PNC. Conclusions. Four out of ten women did not receive quality PNC, especially in women of native ethnicity or residents of the highlands or rural areas, groups that would require prioritization in maternal health strategies. © 2019, Instituto Nacional de Salud.

In order to address this problem, the Peruvian Ministry of Health has focused on improving access to primary healthcare and providing maternal and child health monitoring and education. Current maternal-child health policies in Peru introduce recommendations that are in some respect distinct from those of Indigenous highland communities. This paper analyses the similarities and differences between public health and mothers' infant feeding recommendations. Furthermore, it analyses persistence and change in those recommendations among women who were mothers before and after the introduction of current public health policies. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 older mothers, 15 currently breastfeeding mothers, and 15 public health staff in highland rural communities of Peru. During data analysis, thematic codes and text passages were used in an iterative analytic process to document emerging themes. Results: The results highlight the existence of a traditional corpus of beliefs surrounding infant feeding and care that is consistent with Andean ethnomedical beliefs. This is illustrated by mother's accounts referring to the importance of maintaining a dietary balance of fluids and semi-fluids and of maintaining harmony with the elements in the natural environment. Mothers also incorporate aspects of public health recommendations that they find useful including initiating breastfeeding immediately after birth and exclusive breastfeeding up until 6months. There are also tensions between the two systems including differences in the conceptualization of breastfeeding and infant food, the imposition of public health care services by coercive means, and negative stereotyping of rural Andean diets and mothers. Conclusions: Identifying similarities and differences between distinct systems may provide useful input for effective intercultural health policies. Sources of tension should be carefully assessed with the aim of improving public health policies. Such efforts should apply a process of cultural humility engaging health care professionals in exchange and conversations with patients and communities acknowledging the assumptions and beliefs that are embedded in their own understanding. This process should also recognize and value the knowledge and practices of Andean mothers and their role as primary caretakers. © 2018 The Author(s).","Andes; Breastfeeding; Ethnomedicine; Infant feeding; Intercultural health; Public health","article; baby food; breast feeding; child health; conversation; data analysis; diet; education; female; health care policy; human; infant; monitoring; mother; Peru; primary health care; public health service; rural population; semi structured interview; staff; stereotyping; tension; traditional medicine; adult; attitude to health; comparative study; developing country; ethnology; health education; indigenous health care; interview; male; management; procedures; public health; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Attitude to Health; Breast Feeding; Developing Countries; Female; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Policy; Health Services, Indigenous; Humans; Infant; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Policy Making; Public Health; Rural Population","","M.

We investigated ethnic inequalities among these groups in population coverage with reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions. Methods: We analysed 16 standardised, nationally representative surveys carried out from 2004 to 2015 in Latin America and the Caribbean that provided information on ethnicity or a proxy indicator (household language or skin colour) and on coverage of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions. We selected four outcomes: coverage with modern contraception, antenatal care coverage (defined as four or more antenatal visits), and skilled attendants at birth for women aged 15–49 years; and coverage with three doses of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT3) vaccine among children aged 12–23 months. We classified women and children as indigenous, of African descent, or other ancestry (reference group) on the basis of their self-reported ethnicity or language. Mediating variables included wealth quintiles (based on household asset indices), woman's education, and urban-rural residence. We calculated crude and adjusted coverage ratios using Poisson regression. Findings: Ethnic gaps in coverage varied substantially from country to country. In most countries, coverage with modern contraception (median coverage ratio 0·82, IQR 0·66–0·92), antenatal care (0·86, 0·75–0·94), and skilled birth attendants (0·75, 0·68–0·92) was lower among indigenous women than in the reference group. Only three countries (Nicaragua, Panama, and Paraguay) showed significant gaps in DPT3 coverage between the indigenous and the reference groups. The differences were attenuated but persisted after adjustment for wealth, education, and residence. Women and children of African descent showed similar coverage to the reference group in most countries. Interpretation: The lower coverage levels for indigenous women are pervasive, and cannot be explained solely by differences in wealth, education, or residence. Interventions delivered at community level—such as vaccines—show less inequality than those requiring access to services, such as birth attendance. Regular monitoring of ethnic inequalities is essential to evaluate existing initiatives aimed at the inclusion of minorities and to plan effective multisectoral policies and programmes.

In 2003 both Brazilian and Peru governments have finished paving an international road connecting remotes areas in the Brazilian Amazon to the Pacific coast in Peru. Methods: The situation of prenatal care and child delivery with mothers of children under 5 years old living in the urban area of Assis Brasil, Acre was assessed in two cross-sectional studies performed in 2003 and 2011, corresponding to the period before and after the Pacific highway construction. Results: In 2003, most mothers were of black/Afro-American ethnicity, or ""pardos"" (the offspring of a Caucasian with a African descendant) (77.69 %), had more than 4 years of schooling (73.40 %) and had a mean age of 22.18 years. In 2011, the number of as a migration of indigenous women increased from 0 to 14.40 % of the respondents, because of migration from communities along the rivers to urban areas, with no other significant changes in maternal characteristics. No significant improvement in childbirth assistance was noticed between 1997 and 2011; only the percentage of in-hospital vaginal deliveries performed by doctors increased from 17.89 to 66.26 % (p <0.001) during this period. Access to prenatal care was associated with white ethnicity in 2003, and higher socioeconomic level and white ethnicity in 2011, while the higher number of prenatal visits was associated with higher maternal education and higher socioeconomic levels in 2011. Vaginal child delivery at a hospital facility was associated with maternal age in 2003, and year of birth, being of white ethnicity and higher level of education in 2011. Conclusions: The indicators of prenatal care and child delivery were below the national average, showing that geographical isolation still affects women's health care in the Amazon, despite the construction of the highway and governmental health protocols adopted during this period. © 2016 Guimarães et al.","Amazon; Childbirth; Prenatal care","adult; African American; Caucasian; child; cross-sectional study; education; ethnicity; female; highway; hospital; human; human experiment; maternal age; prenatal care; progeny; river; urban area; vaginal delivery; women's health; Brazil; building industry; ethnic group; health care delivery; obstetric delivery; pregnancy; procedures; psychology; standards; statistics and numerical data; trends; utilization; Adult; Construction Industry; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery, Obstetric; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care","This study received financial aid of UFAC (Brazil) and FUNTAC (Programa Pesquisa para o SUS Edital MS/CNPq/FDCT-FUNTAC/SESACRE n. 01/09) and support from UFAC Master Program in Public Health, Instituto Nacional de Salud e Dirección Regional de Salud de Madre de Dios.

Describe the diversity of traditional healers, their links with the formal health system and changes in their therapeutic resources in two rural Andean communities in Churcampa, in the region of Huancavelica, Peru. Materials and methods. Qualitative study which combined three ethnographic techniques: in depth interviews, observations and accompaniments to traditional healers and health care personnel. Results. 58 traditional healers, classified as healers, midwives and bonesetters were identified. Most healers interviewed learned their work while young and few had a teacher or mentor. The vast majority have objections to linking with health care facilities beyond referrals. There was no coordinated work among health personnel and traditional healers. However, when it happened, health personnel preferred those healers who have the willingness to adapt to the needs of the health services. We found that most of the healers were changing their practices due to the influence of evangelical churches. No healer had disciples to transmit their knowledge and practices. Conclusions. There is great diversity of traditional healers. This diversity is decreasing, among other factors, by the advance of the evangelical churches. Traditional healers refer some patients to the health facility; while health personnel establish hierarchical working relationships with the healers. It is necessary to work on these attitudes of the health care personnel, since the basis of an intercultural approach is to have coordinated and horizontal working relationships between both systems. © 2015, Instituto Nacional de Salud.

Evaluate the nutritional status of indigenous and nonindigenous children under 5 in two provinces in the Peruvian Amazon. Methods. Descriptive cross-sectional representative study of families with children under 5 in the provinces of Bagua and Condorcanqui in Peru. The study consisted of an interview with the child's or children's mother or caregiver, anthropometric assessment, capillary hemoglobin measurement, screening for intestinal parasites in children under 5, access to health services, history of acute respiratory infections and acute diarrheal diseases, socioeconomic status, and intake of inadequately iodized salt. Using generalized linear methods, the determinants of chronic malnutrition and anemia in children were identified in each study population. Results. A total of 986 families and 1 372 children were assessed. The prevalence of chronic malnutrition was higher in the indigenous population than in the nonindigenous population (56.2% versus 21.9%); likewise for anemia (51.3% versus 40.9%). The determinants of chronic malnutrition in the two populations differed. In the indigenous population, the main determinants were an age of more than 36 months (OR 2.21; CI95% 1.61-3.04) and substandard housing (OR 2.9; CI95% 1.19-7.11), while in the non-indigenous population, they were extreme poverty (OR 2.31; IC95% 1.50-3.55) and institutional birth (OR 3.1; IC95% 2.00-4.83). Conclusions. There are marked gaps between the indigenous population and the nonindigenous population in terms of living conditions, access to health services, and the nutritional status of children under 5. Particular attention should be paid to the indigenous population to improve the way state programs and services are delivered in these contexts.","Child health; Child nutrition disorders; Health of indigenous peoples; Perú","anemia; child health; cross section; diarrheal disease; health care; health services; hemoglobin; indigenous population; malnutrition; nutritional disorder; poverty; respiratory disease; socioeconomic status; Amazonia; Bagua; Condorcanqui; Peru; American Indian; Child Nutrition Disorders; comparative study; cross-sectional study; ethnic group; ethnology; female; Growth Disorders; health care delivery; health disparity; health status indicator; human; infant; Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic; literacy; male; preschool child; social determinants of health; statistics and numerical data; Anemia; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status Disparities; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Indians, South American; Infant; Literacy; Male; Poverty; Social Determinants of Health","","A.

We conducted the first experimental study to evaluate whether health providers in Peru provide differential quality of care for family planning services, based on the indigenous or mestizo (mixed ethnoracial ancestry) profile of the patient. In a crossover randomized controlled trial conducted in 2012, a sample of 351 out of the 408 public health establishments in Metropolitan Lima, Peru were randomly assigned to receive unannounced simulated patients enacting indigenous and mestizo profiles (sequence-1) or mestizo and then indigenous profiles (sequence-2), with a five week wash-out period. Both ethnic profiles used the same scripted scenario for seeking contraceptive advice but had distinctive cultural attributes such as clothing, styling of hair, make-up, accessories, posture and patterns of movement and speech. Our primary outcome measure of quality of care is the proportion of technical tasks performed by providers, as established by Peruvian family planning clinical guidelines. Providers and data analysts were kept blinded to the allocation. We found a non-significant mean difference of -0.7% (p = 0.23) between ethnic profiles in the percentage of technical tasks performed by providers. However we report large deficiencies in the compliance with quality standards of care for both profiles. Differential provider behaviour based on the patient's ethnic profiles compared in the study did not contribute to deficiencies in family planning outcomes observed. The study highlights the need to explore other determinants for poor compliance with quality standards, including demand and supply side factors, and calls for interventions to improve the quality of care for family planning services in Metropolitan Lima. © 2015 Planas et al.","","cosmetic; adult; Article; body posture; clothing; consultation; contraceptive device; controlled study; cultural factor; emotion; ethnicity; experimental study; family planning; female; hair; health care quality; help seeking behavior; human; indigenous people; Mestizo; movement (physiology); outcome assessment; Peru; public health; randomized controlled trial; socioeconomics; speech; clinical trial; crossover procedure; epidemiology; ethnic group; health care cost; health care delivery; male; statistics and numerical data; Cross-Over Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Ethnic Groups; Family Planning Services; Female; Health Care Costs; Humans; Male; Quality of Health Care","","","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","19326203","","POLNC","25671664","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923037132"

The region's Indigenous peoples are considered to be at heightened risk given their relatively poor health outcomes, marginal social status, and resource-based livelihoods; however, little attention has been given to these most vulnerable of the vulnerable. This paper contributes to addressing this gap by taking a bottom-up approach to assessing health vulnerabilities to climate change in two Batwa Pygmy communities in rural Uganda. Rapid Rural Appraisal and PhotoVoice field methods complemented by qualitative data analysis were used to identify key climate-sensitive, community-identified health outcomes, describe determinants of sensitivity at multiple scales, and characterize adaptive capacity of Batwa health systems. The findings stress the importance of human drivers of vulnerability and adaptive capacity and the need to address social determinants of health in order to reduce the potential disease burden of climate change. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation; Batwa; Climate change; Health; Indigenous peoples; PhotoVoice; Uganda; Vulnerability","adaptation; bottom-up approach; climate change; climate effect; health geography; health impact; indigenous population; rural society; social status; vulnerability; adolescent; adult; article; controlled study; environmental stress; exposure; female; health behavior; health care system; health status; human; indigenous people; malaria; male; malnutrition; methodology; PhotoVoice; Rapid Rural Appraisal; respiratory tract disease; rural area; stomach disease; Uganda; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Climate Change; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Photography; Qualitative Research; Risk Factors; Rural Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Vulnerable Populations","We kindly thank the communities of Mukongoro, Kihembe, and Buhoma for their participation, and particularly those providing their time for interviews.

We evaluated the genetic structure of the population from Lima (Peru) and performed a case-control genetic association study to test the contribution of African, European, or Native American ancestry to risk for gastric cancer, controlling for the effect of non-genetic factors. A wide set of socioeconomic, dietary, and clinic information was collected for each participant in the study and ancestry was estimated based on 103 ancestry informative markers. Although the urban population from Lima is usually considered as mestizo (i.e., admixed from Africans, Europeans, and Native Americans), we observed a high fraction of Native American ancestry (78.4% for the cases and 74.6% for the controls) and a very low African ancestry (<5%). We determined that higher Native American individual ancestry is associated with gastric cancer, but socioeconomic factors associated both with gastric cancer and Native American ethnicity account for this association. Therefore, the high incidence of gastric cancer in Peru does not seem to be related to susceptibility alleles common in this population. Instead, our result suggests a predominant role for ethnic-associated socioeconomic factors and disparities in access to health services. Since Native Americans are a neglected group in genomic studies, we suggest that the population from Lima and other large cities from Western South America with high Native American ancestry background may be convenient targets for epidemiological studies focused on this ethnic group.","","adult; African; American Indian; animal tissue; article; cancer risk; case control study; controlled study; disease association; ethnic group; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genomics; human; nonhuman; nutrition; Peru; socioeconomics; stomach cancer; urban population; Adult; Alleles; Female; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Incidence; Indians, South American; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Socioeconomic Factors; Stomach Neoplasms","","E.

Approach A culturally appropriate delivery care model was developed in poor and isolated rural communities, and implemented between 1999 and 2001 in cooperation with the Quechua indigenous communities and health professionals. Data on birth location and attendance in one health centre have been collected up to 2007. Local setting The international nongovernmental organization, Health Unlimited, and its Peruvian partner organization, Salud Sín Límites Perú, conducted the project in Santillana district in Ayacucho. Relevant changes The model involves features such as a rope and bench for vertical delivery position, inclusion of family and traditional birth attendants in the delivery process and use of the Quechua language. The proportion of births delivered in the health facility increased from 6% in 1999 to 83% in 2007 with high satisfaction levels. Lessons learned Implementing a model of skilled delivery attendance that integrates modern medical and traditional Andean elements is feasible and sustainable. Indigenous women with little formal education do use delivery services if their needs are met. This contradicts common victim-blaming attitudes that ascribe high levels of home births to ""cultural preferences"" or ""ignorance"".","","birth rate; health care; health education; indigenous population; international organization; maternal mortality; nongovernmental organization; rural area; womens health; article; cultural factor; delivery; educational status; female; health care utilization; health service; human; indigenous people; maternity ward; Peru; rural population; trust; Cultural Competency; Female; Health Services, Indigenous; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Maternal Health Services; Midwifery; Parturition; Pregnancy; Ayacucho; South America","","C.
